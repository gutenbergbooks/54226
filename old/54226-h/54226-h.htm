<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

<p>Some years ago I was led to make a study of the Life
and Writings of Spinoza, and took considerable pains
to present the gifted Jew of Amsterdam in such fulness
to the English reader as might suffice to convey
a passable idea of what one of the great misunderstood
and misused among the sons of men was in himself, in
his influence on his more immediate friends and surroundings
through his presence, and on the world for all
time through all his works. This study completed, and
leisure from the more active duties of professional
life enlarging with increasing years, I bethought me
of some other among the sufferers in the holy cause
of human progress as means of occupation and improvement.
Spinoza led, I might say as matter of
course, to Giordano Bruno, with whose writings I was
familiar, and who was Spinoza’s master, if he ever had
a master. But having, at a former period, undertaken
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">x</span>
to edit the works of Harvey for the Sydenham Society,
and the discovery of the circulation of the blood having
become renewed matter of discussion with medical
men and others, labourers in the field of general literature,
I was turned from Bruno to Servetus, as the first
who proclaimed the true way in which the blood from
the right reaches the left chambers of the heart by
passing through the lungs, and who even hinted at its
further course by the arteries to the body at large.</p>

<p>Of Servetus at this time I knew little or nothing,
save that he had been burned as a heretic at Geneva
by Calvin; and of his works I had seen no more than
the extract in which he describes the pulmonary circulation.
But meditating a revision and prospective
publication of the Life of Harvey, with which I had
prefaced my edition of his works, I went in search of
further information concerning the ingenious anatomist
who had not only outstripped his contemporaries, but
his successors, by something like a century in making
so important an induction as the Pulmonary Circulation.
Nor had I far to go. In the ample stores of
the British Museum Library I found a complete mine of
Servetus-literature, and with access to the ‘Christianismi
Restitutio,’ as reproduced by a learned physician,
Dr. De Murr, and other works of the unfortunate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">xi</span>
Servetus, I encountered not only the physiologist
already known to me, but the philosopher and scholar,
the practical physician, freed from the fetters of
medi&aelig;val routine, the geographer and astronomer, the
biblical critic, in days when criticism of the kind, as
we understand the term, was unimagined, and, alas for
him! the most advanced and tolerant of the Reformers,&mdash;that
sacred band to which Servetus by indefeasible
right belongs. Luther, Calvin, and the rest repudiated
the discipline and most of the outward rites and shows
of the Roman Catholic Church; but they retained
the most abstruse of her creeds. Servetus went at
least as far as they in the rejection of externals; but,
appealing to the scriptures of the New Testament, he
satisfied himself and dared to say to the world that
some of the fundamentals of Christianity as formulated
by the Church of Rome, and acquiesced in by the
Reformers of Germany, had no warrant in the teaching
of the Prophet of Nazareth. Rejecting, as he did, the
whole of the post-apostolic dogmatic accretions of the
Church of Rome, Servetus is the source of the more
‘reasonable service’ we are now permitted to render,
and&mdash;strange conjunction!&mdash;through his disastrous intercourse
with Calvin, in no small measure the original
of the free enquiry that is leading on to conclusions yet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">xii</span>
uncontemplated as to man’s relations to the Unseen
and the Eternal.</p>

<p>The life and labours of the man of whom so much
may be said can never be otherwise than interesting to
the world. Nor is it in his life only that Servetus has
been influential. His death has, perhaps, been even
more influential than his life; for when his pyre began
to blaze, the beacon was lighted that first warned effectually
from the shoals of bigotry and intolerance on
which religion misunderstood has made shipwreck so
long. The custom of consigning heretics, as dissidents
in their interpretation of the Jewish Scriptures were
called, to death by fire then began to fall into abeyance;
princes and chief magistrates ceased from assisting at
autos-da-f&eacute; as edifying spectacles; and persecution
to less terrible conclusions&mdash;imprisonment, banishment,
fine, and social ostracism&mdash;has been coming gradually,
however slowly, to an end.</p>

<p>We have more than one book in English purporting
to give an account of the life of Servetus, but none, I
think, that is not either a compilation at second hand,
or a translation wholly or in principal part from the
French. No one among us appears to have referred
to the works of Servetus and his contemporaries for
the information that would have enabled him to give
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">xiii</span>
something like a true presentment of the man as he
lived and died. To do this&mdash;to make the English
reader acquainted with another of the great devoted
men who have toiled on life’s pilgrimage with bleeding
feet, to smooth and make straight the way for others,
healers in the strife and in front of the battle, not to
strike but to staunch the wounds that men in their
ignorance and madness make on one another&mdash;such is
the purpose of the work now presented to the reader.</p>

<p>In appealing mainly to the original sources of information
on the life of Servetus, I have still not failed to
make myself master of what has been done in later days
by others in this direction. The references that occur in
the course of my book to the writings of La Roche,
Allw&ouml;rden, Mosheim, D’Artigny, Trechsel, Rilliet,
and, last but not least, of Henry Tollin, make it unnecessary
for me to do more in this place than to
acknowledge my obligations to them.</p>

<p>One word on the portrait of Servetus. Of the
original of this Mosheim gives a particular account;
but all Tollin’s enquiries, as well as those I have made
myself, lead to the belief that it is no longer in existence.
Doubt has even been expressed as to the
authenticity of this portrait of which we have indifferent
engravings in Hornius’ ‘Kirchengeschichte,’ in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">xiv</span>
Allw&ouml;rden’s ‘Historia,’ and in Mosheim’s ‘Ketzergeschichte.’
After careful study of these, my daughter
has done her best to reproduce in the etching appended
what must have been a striking and is certainly a
typical Spanish countenance.</p>

<p>The etching of Calvin is after an engraving from
one of the numerous more or less authentic portraits
of the Reformer that are extant.</p>

<span class="medium">MICHAEL SERVETUS, HIS BIRTH, PARENTAGE, AND
EARLY EDUCATION.</span></h2>

<p>Michael Serveto, or as we know him best by his
name with the Latin termination, Servetus, appears,
from the most trustworthy information we possess,
to have been born either at Tudela, in the old Spanish
kingdom of Navarre, or at Villaneuva, in that of
Aragon; but whether here or there, and in the year
1509 or 1511, is an open question. In the course of
the Trial he stood at Vienne in Dauphiny, in the
spring of 1553, he says himself that he is a native
of Tudela, and forty-two years of age; which would
make Navarre the country, and 1511 the year, of his
birth. But in the Geneva Trial, only four months
later, he declares that he is of Villanova, and forty-four
years old; which would give us Aragon as the
land, and 1509 as the date, of his nativity. When
he spoke of himself as a Navarrese at Vienne, it
may have been done to conciliate his French judges,
Navarre having once been a province of France,
and the natives of the two countries having still
much in common. It was at a moment, too, when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
he had paramount motives for seeking to conceal
his identity. When he said at Geneva that he was
‘Espagnol Arragonois de Villeneuve’ and forty-four,
he was face to face with one who knew him well,
and when he had neither motive nor opportunity for
concealment. Servetus’s subscription of himself as
‘Michael Serveto, alias Rev&eacute;s, de Aragonia, Hispanus,’
on the title-page of his first work; as ‘Michael Villanovanus,’
on the titles of all the books he edited, and
the name ‘Villeneuve’ by which alone he was known
through the whole of the years he lived in France, to
say nothing of the ‘M. S. V.,’ evidently Michael
Servetus Villanovanus, on the last leaf of the ‘Christianismi
Restitutio,’ the printing of which led to his
death, supply, as it seems, preponderating evidence
as to the place of his birth, though the year may still be
left uncertain. The <i>alias</i> Rev&eacute;s which appears on the
title of the book ‘De Trinitatis Erroribus,’ the first-fruits
of his genius, has hitherto been a puzzle and subject
of debate with his biographers, but can now be
satisfactorily interpreted. Servetus’s mother, it appears,
was of French extraction, of the Rev&eacute;s family, and her
son took occasion in his first work piously to preserve
his mother’s family name beside his proper patronymic.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>
Of the parents of Servetus, however, we in fact know
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
little more than that we have from himself when, on his
trial at Geneva, he informed the Court that they were
<i>d’ancienne race, vivants noblement</i>, of old families and independent,
or in easy circumstances, and that his father
was a Notary by profession. Report adds that he was
of a family which had been jurists for generations, and
that his father was nearly related to Andrea Serveto
d’Aninon, some time Professor of Civil Law in the University
of Bologna, subsequently member of the Cortes
of Aragon, and one of the Council of the Indies. So
much makes it clear that Michael Servetus was of
gentle blood, of Christian parentage, and neither of
Jewish nor Moorish descent, as has been said on no
better ground apparently than that he shows he was
acquainted with Hebrew, had read the Koran, and in
his writings is not intolerant towards Jews and Mahomedans,
like his countrymen.</p>

<p>Neither have we any very precise information as
regards Servetus’s earlier years and education. Of
somewhat slender build, and so of presumably delicate
constitution, though he showed no trace of this in after
life, he is said to have been destined by his parents to
the service of the Church; in which view, whilst yet a
youth, he was placed for nurture in one of the convents
of his native town or its neighbourhood. And this we
should imagine must almost necessarily be true; for
the rudiments of the liberal education Servetus shows
himself to have received, could only have been obtained
in the early part of the sixteenth century in the quiet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
of the cloister, and under the fostering care of some
monk more learned than the general.</p>

<p>The precocious ability and pious temperament with
which we must credit Servetus may have been a further
motive for the line of life chalked out for him by his
parents. The Church was then, as it still continues to
be, the close through which an easy and a pious life can
be best secured where there is neither talent nor aspiration;
as it is also the highway to worldly wealth and
power, where there is ambition and ability to back
what passes for piety. By mental and moral endowment
Servetus probably appeared to all about him a
born churchman, with the crosier, and even the
cardinal’s hat, in perspective. But side by side with
so much that pointed in this direction, the reasoning,
sceptical, and self-sufficing nature of the man that led
the opposite way, as it had not yet appeared, so was it
unsuspected. Servetus as a youth unquestionably received
the education that would have fitted him for the
Priesthood; and we think complacently of the solace
and relaxation from the monotony of monastic life,
which the worthy brother we evoke as his principal
teacher found in imparting all he knew, and pointing
out the onward way to one both apt and eager to learn.
Before leaving the convent, or the convent school,
where he doubtless remained for several years, Servetus
must have been not only a tolerable Latin scholar, but,
it may have been, also grounded in Greek and the
rudiments of Hebrew.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span></p>

<p>At what age Servetus left his convent teachers we
are not informed; some time however, we should
imagine, before definitive vows are required of the
youthful aspirant to the holy office, when aptitude for
the prospective vocation is made subject of particular
inquiry. Now it may have been that he was discovered
to be indifferently qualified by mental constitution
to follow further the line of life intended for
him&mdash;a conclusion to which we are led from all we
know of the man in his works. He was pious enough
and credulous enough through life; but his religion
must be of the kind he thought out for himself, and his
beliefs of his own fashioning, not such as could be presented
to him ready shaped for acceptance. The very
air of Europe at the beginning of the sixteenth
century was alive with mutterings of the storm that
had long been gathering, and found vent at length
through the manly voice of Martin Luther; and when
we find hints that fears of the Inquisition had had
something to do with Servetus’s subsequent movements,
we are disposed to imagine that the call to
free thought which had sprung up on the revival of
letters and found out the northern Monk in his cell,
had also reached the Friar of the south, and from him
flowed over upon the receptive mind of his youthful
scholar.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, when twelve or fourteen years of
age, Servetus appears to have entered as a student at
the University of Saragossa, then the most celebrated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
in Spain; and if he had Peter Martyr de Angleria
among the number of his teachers, as we are assured
he had,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> he was in the hands of one of the most accomplished
as well as liberal-minded men of his age.
Angleria was in fact still more distinguished as a
scholar, diplomatist, teacher and writer, than as a
soldier. Having come to Spain in the suite of one of
the Italian embassies to Ferdinand and Isabella, he
joined the army of the Catholic king and queen as a
volunteer, and having distinguished himself on more
than one occasion in the field, he was presented to
the sovereigns on the conclusion of hostilities, entered
the service of Isabella, in especial, and having taken
orders&mdash;an indispensable condition to acknowledgment
as a teacher&mdash;he was engaged by the queen as tutor and
general supervisor of the education of the host of young
noblemen and gentlemen who thronged the Court.
The influence exerted by such a man in such a situation
cannot be doubted; and it has been surmised that
more than one of the distinguished personages who
appeared in Spain, in the early part of the sixteenth
century, owed not a little of all that made them notable
in after life to their teacher. Angleria was in fact a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
man in advance of his age, morally, and, we must
believe, religiously also&mdash;although Spain was not
always the devoted slave of Rome we have been accustomed
to think her in these our days. He had
seen enough in his campaigning and its consequences
to disgust him with conversions to Christianity at the
point of the sword, and the wholesale deportation from
their native country of a great civilised community
because of their adhesion to the religion of their
fathers. An Italian by birth, it was no part of
Angleria’s religion to hate Jews and Saracens with
such a hatred as made baptizing, banishing, torturing
and putting them to death the virtue it appeared in
the eyes of the Spaniards.</p>

<p>At Saragossa Servetus may have remained four or
five years, working hard at all that qualified him to
appear as he meets us in after life&mdash;perfecting himself
in classics, and introduced not only to the Ethics of
Aristotle and the scholastic philosophy, but also to
the more positive domains of human knowledge&mdash;the
mathematics, astronomy and geography&mdash;geography
more especially, brought into vogue as it was by the
great discoveries of Columbus, Vasco de Gama, and
the hardy navigators and travellers who came after
them, then made accessible to the general reader by
the works of Angleria, Gryn&aelig;us and others.</p>

<p>Having broken definitively with the idea of the
Church as a calling, Servetus must now have made up
his mind to follow what might fairly be spoken of as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
the hereditary vocation of his family&mdash;Law; and the
School of Toulouse being at this time the most celebrated
in Europe, to Toulouse he was sent as a
student of Law by his father. Here he seems to have
remained for two or three years&mdash;short while enough
in which to fathom the intricacies of civil and canon
law, to say nothing of other studies that must have
continued to engage some share of his attention; but
that the time given to the study of Law at Toulouse
was not misspent, is proclaimed by the occasional
scraps of legal lore we notice interspersed in his
writings. In the covenant between God and Abraham,
to cite one among many instances, he observes that we
have the first case on record of one of the four forms of
unindentured contract, still spoken of as the form
<i>Facio ut facias</i>. Elsewhere also, and at other times,
on his trial at Geneva in particular, he is credited
by his prosecutor with an adequate knowledge of the
Pandects, although he says himself that he had never
done more than read Justinian in the perfunctory
manner usual with young men at college. On the occasion
referred to, nevertheless, we find him quoting the
decisions of jurisconsults in support of his conclusions.</p>

<p>But Law, we believe, was never the subject that
engrossed the thoughts of Servetus. The natural bent
of his mind, and the teaching he had received during
his earlier years, led him to Theology; and it was
at Toulouse, as he tells us himself, that he first made
acquaintance with the Scriptures of the Old and New
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
Testaments. It is not difficult to imagine the effect
which the perusal of these writings must have produced
on the ardent religious temperament of Servetus. In
his earliest work he speaks of the Bible as a book come
down from heaven, the source of all his philosophy and
of all his science&mdash;language, however, that is to be
seen as hyperbole to a great extent; for he was already
imbued with scholastic philosophy, and, we must presume,
with patristic theology also, before he had read a
word of the Bible; and in his published works we find
him at various times subordinating the teaching of the
Scriptures to the conclusions of his reason. Toulouse,
indeed, in the early part of the sixteenth century, was
an unlikely school for religious study in any but the
most rigidly orthodox fashion; and how far Michael
Servetus swerved from this&mdash;to his sorrow&mdash;need not
now be more particularly noticed. It was even the
boast of the Toulousans for long, that their city had not
been infected with what was spoken of as the poison of
Lutheranism. So strict a watch had been kept over
them by their shepherds, the priests, that, whilst in
neighbouring and other more distant cities of France
the Reformation had many adherents, it had none&mdash;openly,
at all events&mdash;in Toulouse. It were needless
to insist that training of a special kind, in addition to
originality and independence of mind, was required to
lead to views and conclusions such as those attained to
by Servetus.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span></p>

<p>He had read the Bible, however, at Toulouse; and
there, too, if it were not at an earlier period, he must
have met with some of the writings of Luther, of
which several had been translated into Spanish soon
after their publication.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> But there is another book
which enjoyed an extensive reputation through the
whole of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and
seems to supply the kind of aliment precisely of which
a mind constituted like that of Servetus must have felt
the want. This is the ‘Theologia Rationalis sive Liber
de Creaturis’ of Raymund de Sabunde, in which the
Creator is reached by a gradual ascent from lower to
higher grades of created things.</p>

<p>The ‘Rational Theology’ of Sabunde is indeed a
most noteworthy book; full of true piety, resting on
the wider and surer grounds of nature at large in harmony
with human intelligence, than the dogmatic theologian
can show in the written text and unwritten
traditions on which he relies for his conclusions. Containing
no word that is not thoroughly orthodox, doctrine,
nevertheless, is not that which it is the grand
object of the ‘Rational Theology’ of Sabunde to propound.
Neither is authority paraded, as it would
have been had the book been written by a professed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
theologian, instead of a pious naturalist; for Sabunde
was a physician, one of the guild whose destiny it is to
lead the van of progress. We cannot believe that the
work, though often reprinted, was ever heartily approved
by the heads of the Church of Rome. Its title
went far to condemn it. The Roman Catholic Church
requires faith, submissiveness, subserviency, not reason,
of its sons; and we are not, therefore, surprised to find
that though the ‘Rational Theology’ of Sabunde, as a
whole, long escaped being placed on the index of prohibited
books, the prologue with which we find one of
the early editions, if it be not the first (Argentorati,
1496), introduced, was soon ordered to be expunged;
nor, indeed, as culture extended and the Reformation
spread, with ever-increasing alarm to the dominant
Church, that the book itself was at length pointedly
forbidden to be read by the faithful. It was put upon
the ‘Index’ by the Congregation of the Council of
Trent in 1595, the author ‘holding too much by
Nature,’ say the reverend councillors, ‘to give us a
knowledge of God and his providential dealing with
the world, and making too little reference to the
Fathers and the authority of Holy Writ.’</p>

<p>The Prologue of Sabunde is in truth a very remarkable
piece of writing, the age considered in which
it flowed from the pen. Beginning in the accredited
orthodox fashion: ‘Ad laudem et gloriam altissim&aelig; et
gloriosissim&aelig; Trinitatis,’ &amp;c., the author proceeds to
say that his purpose is ‘to expose the errors, as well
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
of the ancient philosophers as of pagan and infidel
writers, by the science he has to propound; to set
forth the catholic faith in its infallible truthfulness,
and to show every sect opposed thereunto in its
necessary falsity and erroneousness. Two books,’ he
continues, ‘are given to us by God for our guidance:
one, the universal book of created things, or the book
of Nature; the other, the book of the sacred Scriptures.
The first was given to man from the beginning, when
the world was made; the second is to supplement and
solve the difficulties met with in the first. The book
of the Creatures lies open to all; but the book of the
Scriptures can only be read aright by the clergy. The
book of Nature cannot be falsified, neither can it be
readily interpreted amiss, even by heretics; but the
book of the Scriptures they can misconstrue and falsify
at their pleasure.’ The author’s design, therefore, is to
write a book which gentle and simple alike may read
and understand without a master; and he ends his
prologue with a compliment and submission to Holy
Mother Church, which her hierarchs, however, have
not accepted either gratefully or graciously; for they did
not of old, any more than they do now, want books that
would enable readers to go their own way without the
guiding hand of a master. Shall we wonder, therefore,
that this notable prologue was looked on at an early
date as highly objectionable, and is not to be found in
any of the later editions of the book?<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span></p>

<p>Michel de Montaigne has given an interesting account
of this ‘Rational Theology’ of Sabunde. His
father thought so highly of it that he set his son, the immortal
Essayist, to translate it into French: a task which
it were needless to say he performed in a very admirable
manner, though the sire did not live to see the work in
type and in the hands of the public he was anxious to
reach through its means. The book, says Montaigne,
is composed by a Spaniard, in indifferent Latin&mdash;<i>basti
d’un Espagnol, baraguin&eacute; des terminaisons Latines</i>&mdash;but
well adapted to meet a want of the day. The
novelties of Luther coming into vogue and shaking old
beliefs, Sabunde, as he thinks, ‘gives very good advice
against a disease that ever tends towards execrable
atheism.’ If Sabunde does give <i>tres bon advis</i>, his
‘Book of the Creatures’ is nevertheless the text from
which the most sceptical perhaps of the whole series of
the ‘Essays’ is written; and if the ‘Theologia Rationalis’
fell into the hands of the youthful Michael
Servetus, as we believe it must almost necessarily
have done, we have no difficulty in imagining that it
influenced him in a still greater degree, and not much
otherwise than it did young Michel de Montaigne.
A rational exposition of God’s revelation of himself in
nature, we apprehend, must have been a craving in the
soul of the serious Spaniard still more than in that of
the lively Gascon.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span></p>

<p>But there is another writer whose influence on his
age and the progress of free thought it is impossible to
estimate too highly, and from whose teaching Servetus
on his death-walk owned that he had had <i>something</i>.
This is Erasmus. What Servetus had he does not
say. Whatever it may have been, it was unaccompanied
by the caution and cold discretion that distinguished
the great scholar of Rotterdam. In the Scholia
which Erasmus added to his Greek New Testament,
however, we fancy we see heralds of the far bolder and
more original exegetical annotations with which Servetus,
under his assumed name of Villanovanus, accompanied
his reprint of the Pagnini Bible, which we shall
have to speak of by and by.</p>

<p>In addition to all he learned from his convent
teachers, from the professors of Saragossa and
Toulouse, from Sabunde, Luther, Erasmus, and others
on the subject of theology, Servetus must further have
been well read in general history and the works of
travellers in foreign lands, as we shall find when we
come to study his edition of Ptolemy’s Geography, and
refer particularly to his biblical criticisms, in days when
criticism of the kind he brought to bear on the text of
the Scriptures was unknown. It was only in the early
part of the sixteenth century that the Hebrew Bible
and Greek Testament began to be appealed to by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
learned, and made the subject of critical study in a
way never thought of before. Long limited to the
letter, the study was widened in its scope by Servetus,
and, embracing general history, made to include
a new and highly important element in its bearing on
the Religious Idea. If Servetus of himself arrived at
the interpretation he gives of the Psalms and Prophetical
writings of Israel, he must indeed have been
possessed of no ordinary share of natural sagacity
informed by study, and of moral courage in addition;
for it runs counter to all that had been assumed from
the date of the New Testament writings almost to the
present day. The free use he makes of his historical
reading in its application to David, Cyrus, and Hezekiah,
may have been that which led some of his
biographers to imagine that he was of Jewish descent,
and to say that he had visited Africa, and had had
Mahomedan as well as Jewish teachers, from whom
he imbibed his notions, hostile to the common orthodox
interpretation of the Prophets, and the conception
of a Triune God.</p>

<p>It were absurd to suppose that Servetus’s early
convent education and subsequent studies at Saragossa
and Toulouse had made him all he shows himself to
be in his works. He continued a student through the
whole of his life, and it is indeed among the privileges
of the physician that his education never ends; but it
was certainly at an early period of his career that he
became possessed of the theological ideas which he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
went on elaborating, even to the day when his
‘Restoration of Christianity’ was in type and ready
for the publication it did not obtain. It is therefore of
moment with us to seize and follow up every incident
in his life that induced or strengthened the bent of his
mind towards theological speculation; and the event
which now befel, we must presume, had no slight influence
in this direction.

<span class="medium">SERVICE WITH FRIAR JUAN QUINTANA, CONFESSOR OF
THE EMPEROR CHARLES V.</span></h2>

<p>School and college days come naturally to an end, or
are cut short by one intervening incident or another;
and the studies of Michael Servetus at Toulouse were
interrupted by an invitation to enter his service from
brother Juan Quintana, a Franciscan friar, confessor
to the Emperor Charles V., about to attend on his
Sovereign to his coronation in the imperial city of
Bologna, and, of still greater significance, to the Diet of
Augsburg, which followed it closely. In what capacity
Servetus joined Quintana we are not informed; but if
father confessors ever engaged private secretaries, we
can hardly doubt that it must have been in the intimate
relationship suggested, for which the accomplishments
of the younger man so obviously qualified him. The invitation
from Quintana is interesting on many accounts,
and was certainly an important element in the mental
development of Servetus. Though he may have
quitted Spain hurriedly, perhaps secretly&mdash;in fear of
the Inquisition, as said&mdash;he could have left nothing but
a good name for conduct and accomplishment behind
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
him, otherwise he would never have been recommended
as a fit and proper person to act as secretary to the
confessor of the great Emperor. Not forgotten by his
old masters of Saragossa, the clever student was thought
of by them when Quintana made known his want of a
secretary, and must have been recommended to him as
in every way qualified to fill a situation of the kind.</p>

<p>Michael Servetus, as we apprehend him, was one
of those sensitive natures which, like the stainless plate
of the photographer, retains at once and reflects every
object presented to it; his service with Quintana, consequently,
was one of the incidents that influenced the
whole of his after life. Up to the time of his engagement
with the confessor he had been but one among hundreds
of other students, known to his teachers as a young man
of superior abilities, it may be, but not an object of
more particular attention to any one of them. In the
intimate relationship implied between the elderly principal
and the youthful underling matters were entirely
changed; and recent inquiries<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> lead to the conclusion
that the hood of the barefooted friar Juan Quintana
covered the head of a man of superior powers, cherishing
larger, more liberal and more tolerant views than
were current in his age, more especially among the
class to which he belonged.</p>

<p>Quintana appears to have attracted the notice of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
the Emperor so far back as the date of the Diet of
Worms, during the sittings of which he had distinguished
himself as a preacher and become generally
known as a theologian and man of learning. He had
at the same time, however, and in like measure, fallen
out of favour with his party, opposed at every point to
the reform movement, in consequence of the moderation
of his views. Matters at Worms had gone in no
wise to the satisfaction of the Emperor, owing in no
inconsiderable degree, as he must have believed, to the
intolerance and mismanagement of his clerical advisers.
To give the approaching Diet of Augsburg, of which
Charles was thinking far more seriously than of the
pageant of Bologna when he made Quintana his confessor,
a chance of proving the bond of union he desired
between the two great religious parties which now
divided his empire, he saw that he must rid himself of
the narrow-minded and utterly irreconcilable Dominican
Loaysa, whom he had had at Worms as his spiritual
director. From Loaysa he knew he had no prospect
of receiving those counsels of concession and compromise
which, as a politician, he saw were indispensable
and to which he was himself at the moment by no means
disinclined. He must have another confessor of more
liberal views, not utterly opposed to the reformation
of the Church in all its aspects and to the whole body
of the Reformers with whom, as heretics, it was condescension
on the part of a Roman Catholic dignitary
to communicate, and contamination, if it were not sin, to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
sympathise. The old director had therefore to be got
rid of, for a time at least; but he must suffer no slight,
be subjected to no show of mistrust, to no seeming loss
of confidence; he must not even be superseded in his
office, but only removed to a distance and so made
innocuous. Charles therefore discovered that a representative,
who must be presumed to be familiar with
the most secret aspirations of his soul, would be required
at Rome as the medium of communication between
himself and his holiness the Pope, in connection with
the important business in prospect at Augsburg.
Loaysa, accordingly&mdash;greatly to his disgust beyond
question&mdash;was dispatched with all the honours to Rome,
whilst Juan Quintana, summoned from the quiet of the
cloister to the bustle of the Court, found himself unexpectedly
with a royal and imperial penitent at
his ear in the confessional, and an upper seat in the
council chamber pending the discussion of affairs of
state.</p>

<p>How should we imagine that an invitation to take
service with a man possessed of qualities that
brought him into such relationships could have been
otherwise than instantly embraced by the youthful
student of Toulouse; or how doubt that intimate
contact with so great a nature as Quintana’s could fail
to impress him deeply? Attached forthwith to the
service of the confessor and in the suite of the Emperor,
not the least observant among all who accompanied
him of the pomp and pageantry displayed at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
coronation at Bologna, the open-eyed secretary was
witness of much besides that sank into his mind, gave
matter for future thought, and found free but needlessly
offensive expression in his writings. Here, at
Bologna, it was in fact, and not at Rome as has been
said, that Servetus saw the Pope ‘borne aloft above
the heads of the people, the multitude kneeling in the
dust, adoring him, and they among them who could
but kiss his slipper accounting themselves blessed.’
Nor was it the ignorant multitude alone that showed
such abject servility. He saw in addition ‘the most
powerful prince of his age, at the head of twenty
thousand veteran soldiers, kneeling and kissing the feet
of the Pope;’<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> an exhibition which appears to have
been thought of as simply degrading instead of
edifying by the independent-minded secretary.</p>

<p>So great an event as the coronation of the Emperor
was too favourable an occasion to be neglected for a
stroke of business by the financiers of the Romish
Church: indulgences were in the market in plenty, and
at prices to suit all purchasers, immunity from the pains
of purgatory being to be obtained for terms in the
ratio of the money paid. How shall we imagine that
so glaring an abuse could fail to touch Servetus, in the
state of mind to which he must already have attained,
in the same way as the proceedings of Tetzel and his
coadjutors touched the common sense and conscience
of Luther? It was doubtless with all he now observed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
before him that we, short while after, find him speaking
in such virulent terms of the Papacy and exclaiming:
‘O bestia bestiarum, meretrix sceleratissima’&mdash;‘O beast
most beastly, most wicked of harlots!’<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> Some of
Luther’s epithets, we might conclude, had found their
way into the vocabulary of Servetus; and it may be that
the violence of Luther’s invective, unchallenged by the
rest of the Reformers, led him to fancy that he too
might indulge without impropriety in language of an
unseemly kind.</p>

<p>When we think of the times in which Servetus
lived, his early education and subsequent surroundings,
the violent hatred he seems already to have conceived
against the Papacy is not a little extraordinary. We
might be tempted to conclude that the free thought of
Europe, of which the Reformation was the outcome and
expression, had found even a more genial soil in the
mind of this Spanish youth than in that of Luther
himself, or any of his accredited followers. They went
little way in freeing the religion of Jesus of Nazareth
from the accretions which metaphysical subtlety, superstition,
and ignorance of the laws of nature and the
principles of things had gathered around it in the
course of ages. Their business, as they apprehended
it, was to reform the Church rather than the religion
of which it was presumed to be the exponent; the
task that Servetus set himself in the end was to
reform religion, with little thought of a Church in any
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
sense in which an institution of the kind was conceived
in his day, whether by Papist or Protestant.</p>

<p>From reading the Bible at Toulouse and contrasting
the humble life and simple theistic morality of the
Prophet of Nazareth with the metaphysical subtleties
and dogmatic deductions of the schoolmen, the pomp,
the power, the tyranny and the greed of the priests
so conspicuously displayed at Bologna, we can readily
imagine the impression made on the independent spirit
of Servetus&mdash;an impression that found more seemly
utterance anon than that we have already quoted, and in
words like these: ‘For my own part I neither agree nor
disagree in every particular with either Catholic or
Reformer. Both of them seem to me to have something
of truth and something of error in their views;
and whilst each sees the other’s shortcomings, neither
sees his own. God in his goodness give us all to
understand our errors and incline us to put them
away. It would be easy enough, indeed, to judge dispassionately
of everything, were we but suffered without
molestation by the Churches freely to speak our
minds; the older exponents of doctrine, in obedience
to the recommendation of St. Paul, giving place to
younger men, and these in their turn making way for
teachers of the day who had aught to impart that had
been revealed to them. But our doctors now contend
for nothing but power. The Lord confound all
tyrants of the Church! Amen.’&mdash;The voice of this
nineteenth century verging on its close, from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
mouth of a man little more than of age, living in the
first half of the sixteenth!<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>The business of the coronation at Bologna concluded,
the Emperor betook himself to Germany in
view of the great Diet of Augsburg, formally inaugurated
in the summer of 1530, accompanied of
course by his confessor, as the confessor was attended
by his youthful secretary. And here it must have
been that Servetus saw and may perchance have
spoken with Melanchthon and others of the leading
Reformers, among the number of whom, however, the
greatest of them all did not appear. Luther’s friends
believed that the danger he must run by showing
himself at Augsburg was too great to be incurred.
The brave man would himself have faced the peril,
but his princely protectors positively forbade the
exposure. They feared that at Augsburg the Emperor
might be tempted to violate the ‘safe conduct’ he had
been reproached by his Papal advisers with having so
honourably observed at Worms; for there were still
some among the Roman Catholics, high in place, so
ill-informed, so blind to events, as to believe that were
the head of the man who had inaugurated the movement
which compromised their power but off his shoulders,
the Reformation would collapse and die! Luther was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
therefore permitted by his friends to approach the
scene of action on this occasion no nearer than
Coburg.</p>

<p>Neither at Augsburg any more than at Worms did
matters proceed so entirely to the satisfaction of the
Emperor as he wished, and may have anticipated. The
Protestant princes, with little cohesion among themselves,
showed, nevertheless, that severally they were
more resolute than ever in their requirements touching
religion, less obsequious too to the advances of their
suzerain than he found agreeable. They felt themselves
in fact, and in so far, masters of the situation,
and had mostly quitted Augsburg before the sittings
of the Diet came to a close, content to leave
Melanchthon and his colleagues to give final shape
to the business for which the Diet had been mainly convoked,
and in the great <span class="smcap">Religious Charter of the Age</span>&mdash;the
Confession of Augsburg&mdash;to establish Protestantism
as an integral and recognised element, not only
in the religious, but in the political system of Europe.</p>

<p>During his attendance on his chief at Augsburg,
Servetus, though he saw and may have spoken with
more than one of the distinguished Reformers, could
have been an object of particular attention to none of
them: his youth and subordinate position precluded
the possibility of this. That he may have been disappointed
at not seeing the original of the great movement
which had brought together the august assembly
he looked on around him, we may well believe, but we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
find no evidence in contemporary documents that
would lead us to think he had ever come into contact
with Luther, as has been said.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span></p>

<h2 id="BOOK_I_CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br />

<span class="medium">THE SERVICE WITH QUINTANA COMES TO AN END.</span></h2>

<p>It is greatly to be regretted that we have nothing from
Servetus on the other impressions he received, during
the term of his service with Quintana, beside those connected
with the pomp and power of the Papacy. We
do not even know precisely how long he continued
with the confessor of the Emperor, nor where, nor at
what moment he left him. Neither have we a word
of his whereabouts and mode of life, after vacating
his office, until we meet him seeking an interview with
Jehan Hausschein, the individual, with his name turned
into Greek, so familiar to the world as Œcolampadius.
From Servetus himself we have it that he quitted the
service of Quintana on his death, which, he says,
occurred in Germany. But the truth of this statement
has been called in question on very sufficient grounds,
Quintana having been seen alive in the flesh, and still
in attendance on the Emperor, years after dates at
which we know positively that Servetus had been in
Basle and Strasburg, communicating with Œcolampadius,
Bucer, and others of the Reformers. More
than this, he had come before the world as author of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
the book entitled ‘De Trinitatis Erroribus,’ a copy of
which having been found by Joannes Cochl&aelig;us, an
ecclesiastic in the suite of the Emperor, in a bookseller’s
shop at Ratisbon, was by him shown to Quintana, who,
we are informed, expressed extreme disgust that a
countryman of his own and personally known to him&mdash;<i>quem
de facie se n&ocirc;sse dicebat</i>&mdash;should have fallen so far
into the slough of heresy as to write on the mystery of
the Trinity in the style of Michael Servetus, alias
Rev&eacute;s.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> Nor indeed is this the last we hear of Quintana.
After the settlement of affairs at Ratisbon and N&uuml;rnberg,
he attended the Emperor to Italy, and thence to
his native Spain, where we find him installed as Prior of
the Church of Monte Aragon and a member of the
Cortes of the kingdom. Quintana appears in fact to
have lived for yet two years, actively engaged in his
duties, having only been gathered to his fathers towards
the end of the year 1534.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>Servetus did not therefore leave the service of
Quintana after, or in consequence of, the death of the
confessor. We find it difficult indeed to think of one
with the decidedly unorthodox opinions to which
Servetus had attained at an early period of his life,
continuing on terms of intimacy with a man of
Quintana’s capacity, without showing something of the
leaven of unbelief that must have been already fermenting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
in his mind. There is, it is true, commonly enough,
so much more of policy than of piety among hierarchs
of the Church of Rome, and indeed of any church
largely possessed of wealth and culture, that their real
opinions and beliefs have often been made subject of
debate. But Quintana was a monk, although a liberal
one, and he was Charles V.’s confessor. Of the
Emperor’s orthodoxy, bigotry, and hatred of heresy,
however, there can be no question; so that, though
policy moved him for a time to entertain as his spiritual
adviser a man more tolerant than the general, the
occasion for this ceasing, Charles was not likely to
find himself altogether at his ease with one at his elbow
much more liberally disposed than himself. Quintana
consequently on the return to Spain, being absolved of
his office of confessor, but handsomely provided for in
the Church, Charles recalled Loaysa, his former director
in matters of faith, from Rome, and lapsed into the
groove of intolerance from which considerations of
state had for a moment withdrawn him.</p>

<p>From the false account Servetus gives of the cause
of his quitting Quintana, we therefore think it probable
that soon after the settlement of matters at Augsburg
in the early autumn of 1530, he had incautiously betrayed
the state of his mind on some point of the
religious question, and been dismissed from his service
by the confessor. Service of any sort, indeed, from the
estimate we are led to form of the mental constitution
of Michael Servetus, could only have been a bondage
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
never patiently to be endured, but to be shaken off
at the earliest possible opportunity. His was not a
nature that could brook a master; and we have the
assurance of Œcolampadius that Michael Servetus was
in Basle and making himself obnoxious by his theological
fancies previous to the month of October 1530.
The coronation at Bologna having taken place in the
autumn of 1529, and the Diet of Augsburg assembled
at midsummer 1530, Servetus could not, thus, have
been in the following of Quintana for more than a year,
or eighteen months&mdash;no long term if reckoned by the
lapse of time, but certainly covering a vast area in the
sphere of his mental development. He may have had
little leisure for the study of books, but he had his eyes
open to the doings of men; and his inner senses were
awakened to truths, his reason to conclusions, that
influenced him through the rest of his life, and possibly
had no insignificant part in bringing him to his untimely
end.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span></p>

<h2 id="BOOK_I_CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.<br />

<span class="medium">INTERCOURSE WITH THE SWISS REFORMERS.</span></h2>

<p>It would appear that Œcolampadius, Bucer, Bullinger,
Zwingli and others, their friends, had had a sort of
‘clerical meeting’ for talking over the theological
questions of the day at Basle in the autumn of 1530.
On this occasion Œcolampadius informed his friends
that he had been troubled of late by a hot-headed
Spaniard, Servetus by name, overflowing with Arian
heresies and other objectionable opinions, maintaining
particularly that Christ was not really and truly the
Eternal Son of God; but if not, then was he not, and
could not be, the Saviour&mdash;<i>were Christus nit r&auml;chter,
warer, ewiger Gott, so were er doch und k&ouml;nte nit seyn
unser Heiland</i>. Waxing warm in his tale, and fearing
that such poison, as he conceived it, would not be poured
into his ears alone, but would reach those of others, he
was minded that measures should be taken against such
a contingency. To this Zwingli, addressing him as
brother Œcolampady, replied, that ‘there did seem
good ground for them to be on their guard; for the false
and wicked doctrine of the troublesome Spaniard goes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
far to do away with the whole of our Christian religion.’
‘God preserve us,’ said he, ‘from the coming in among
us of any such wickedness. Do what you can, then,
to quit the man of his errors, and with good and wholesome
argument win him to the truth.’ ‘That have I
already done,’ said Œcolampady; ‘but so haughty,
daring and contentious is he, that all I say goes for
nothing against him.’ ‘This is indeed a thing insufferable
in the Church of God,’ said Zwingli&mdash;<i>Ein unleydenliche
Sach in der Kyrchen Gottes</i>. Therefore do
everything possible that such dreadful blasphemy get
no further wind to the detriment of Christianity.’<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<p>Besides the personal communication with Œcolampadius
of which we have this interesting notice, Servetus
must have written him several letters&mdash;unfortunately
lost to us&mdash;about the same time, for we have two
from the Reformer to the Spaniard, which have happily
been preserved. In one of these (probably the second
that was written), Servetus having, as it seems, complained
that he had been somewhat sharply handled by
his correspondent, Œcolampadius replies that he, for his
part, thinks that he himself has the greater reason to
complain. ‘You obtrude yourself on me,’ he says, ‘as
if I had nothing else ado than to answer you; asking
me questions about all the foolish things the Sorbonne
has said of the Trinity, and even taking it amiss that I
do not criticise and in your way oppose myself to those
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
distinguished theologians, Athanasius and Nazianzenus.
You contend that the Church has been displaced from
its true foundation of faith in Christ, and feign that we
speak of his filiation in a sense which detracts from the
honour that is due to him as the Son of God. But
it is you who speak blasphemously; for I now understand
the diabolical subterfuges you use. Forbearing
enough in other respects, I own that I am not possessed
of that extreme amount of patience which would keep
me silent when I see Christ dishonoured.’ He then
goes on to criticise and rebut Servetus’s theological
views&mdash;his denial of Two natures in the One person of
Christ, and his opinion that in the prophetical writings
of the Old Testament it is always a prospective or
coming Son of God that is indicated. ‘You,’ continues
Œcolampadius, ‘do not admit that it was the Son of
God who was to come as man; but that it was the man
who came that was the Son of God; language which
leads to the conclusion that the Son of God existed
not eternally before the incarnation.’</p>

<p>To satisfy the Reformer, or seeking to get upon a
better footing with him, Servetus appears now to have
composed and sent him a Confession of Faith, which has
come down to us. On the face of this there was such
a semblance of orthodoxy that Œcolampadius found
nothing at first to object to in its statements; but having
conversed with the writer and heard his explanations,
he had come to see it as utterly fallacious, misleading,
and inadmissible. He concludes by exhorting his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
correspondent to ‘confess the Son to be consubstantial
and coeternal with the Father, in which case,’
he says, ‘we shall be able to acknowledge you for a
Christian.’<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span></p>

<h2 id="BOOK_I_CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.<br />

<span class="medium">THE REFORMERS OF STRASBURG&mdash;PUBLICATION OF THE
WORK ON TRINITARIAN ERROR.</span></h2>

<p>The letter of Œcolampadius, as we have it, is without
date, but must have been written from Basle at the
close of 1530, or the beginning of 1531, and so before
the book on Trinitarian Error had been published, as
we find no mention made of the work. By this time,
however, Servetus must have had the treatise ready for
press, for it was now that he put it into the hands of
Conrad Kœnig or Rous, a publisher, having establishments
both at Basle and Strasburg. Kœnig was not
a printer himself; but accepting the work for publication
he sent it to Jo. Secerius, of Hagenau, in Alsace,
a well-known typographer of the day, to be put into
type. To Hagenau accordingly went the MS., followed
by the author to superintend the printing; intending
from thence to proceed to Strasburg, where he was
anxious to have interviews with the leading Reformers
of that city, Martin Bucer and W. F. Capito, and propound
to them, as he had done to the Switzers, the
new views of Christian doctrine at which he had
arrived.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span></p>

<p>From what we know already we might conclude
that he found little more encouragement from the ministers
of Strasburg than he had had from those of Basle.
Servetus himself, however, appears to have thought
otherwise, and left them with the impression that
neither of the Strasburgers was so wholly opposed to
his views as Œcolampadius in particular had shown
himself at Basle. We find him, by and by, in fact,
speaking as if he even believed that in the first instance
they were alike disposed to abet rather than condemn
his conclusions. And this, from what came out subsequently,
seems really to have been the case, in so far, at
least, as Capito stands concerned. Capito was, in fact, the
most advanced and truly tolerant of all the early Reformers,
and if we may rely on the report we have of his
opinions from the author of the ‘Antitrinitarian Library,’<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>
he was really not behind Servetus in his rejection of the
orthodox tripartite Deity. A kindly sympathy with a
young enthusiast, full of fancies on topics really beyond
the reach of demonstration, may have induced Bucer
as well as his colleague, Capito, to feel a certain interest
in the subject of our study, and so led them both to
treat him otherwise than as the irreverent dreamer he
had appeared to Œcolampadius; to see him, in a word,
as he was in truth&mdash;a well-read and piously disposed,
albeit in their opinion a more or less mistaken, scholar.</p>

<p>Servetus undoubtedly possessed the character of the
enthusiast in perfection, and by natural constitution
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
was not only indisposed, but to a certain extent incapable
of seeing a question in any light save that in
which he set it himself. Bucer, although he became
hostile to Servetus in the end, must in fact have been
not a little taken with him on their earlier intercourse,
when in a letter to a friend he speaks of him as ‘his
dear son’&mdash;‘filius meus dilectus.’ When not curtly
met as the rash innovator and heretic, Servetus was
neither the proud nor the impracticable man he appeared
to Œcolampadius and Calvin. During his visit
to Strasburg, when he was doubtless busy with his ‘De
Trinitatis Erroribus’&mdash;revising, polishing, and seeing it
through the press&mdash;in a notable modification of the
terms in which one of the cardinal points of his doctrine
is spoken of in an earlier and in a later passage of
the work, Bucer’s kindly counsel, it is presumed, may
be detected. Whilst in Book IV. we find these words,
‘The Word is never spoken of in Scripture as the Son;
the Word was the shadow only, Christ was the substance,’
in Book VII. he says, ‘The Word is never
spoken of in Scripture as the Son; but to Christ himself
there is ascribed a kind of eternity of engenderment.
The things that were under the <i>Law</i> were
shadows of the body of Christ.’<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p>Whatever the two distinguished Reformers of Strasburg
may have said, however&mdash;and we can hardly
doubt of their having tried to win him to the views that
were commonly entertained&mdash;he was not stayed for a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
moment in his purpose of getting into print. Nay&mdash;and
we know not why the right should be refused him&mdash;he
seems to have thought himself at as full liberty as
the leaders of the great movement then afoot to give
his own interpretation of the kind of reform which not
the Church only, but its doctrine, required. For such
an undertaking he was as well qualified by culture as
any of the Reformers&mdash;better qualified, in fact, than
many among them, as in genius we believe he was
surpassed, and in liberality and tolerance approached
by none. Servetus, in truth, had started in the reforming
race unweighted, and so, and in so far with a better
chance of reaching the goal of simple truth than either
Luther or Calvin; for though he had received the education
of the cloister, he was neither professed monk
nor priest; and, without detriment to the piety of his
spirit, or his belief in what were held by the world as
the oracles of God, he had freed himself from the
fetters of necessary assent to the interpretations put
upon these, formulated into dogmas, by the Church in
which he had been born and bred. Servetus seems
never to have had any misgivings about his title to
show himself among the number of the Reformers. He
was in Germany, the land of free thought, as he imagined;
among men who had thought freely, and whom
he had been used to hear spoken of by his clerical surroundings,
whilst in the suite of Quintana, as heretics
and blasphemers. These names he did not fear in
such respectable company as he found the Reformers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
of Switzerland and Germany to be; and though he did
not agree with them on some topics, he could bear
with them as well in that wherein he differed from
them as in that wherein they differed among themselves,
and saw no reason why they should not in like
manner bear with him. He thought of nothing, therefore,
but prospective fame for himself in the publication
he contemplated. The names of Luther, Melanchthon,
Calvin, and the rest, appeared on the title-pages of their
works: why, then, should his name be withheld from
the world? On the title-page of the ‘Seven Books
on Mistaken Conceptions of the Trinity’ accordingly,
which now came forth from the press, we find not only
his family name, Servetus, but the alias, Rev&eacute;s, from
his mother’s side of the house, and the name of the
country that called him son:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>

<p>The publisher and printer, having an eye to
business, not notoriety, and suspicious in all probability
of the reception the article in the production of
which they were aiding and abetting, might receive,
were more cautious than the author; for the name
neither of printer, publisher, nor place of publication,
appears on the title-page. In the month of July, 1531,
however, the book was to be bought at once in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
cities of Strasburg, Frankfort, and Basle: but no one
knew for more than twenty years where it had
been printed, nor who besides the author&mdash;who had
also vanished out of sight&mdash;had been accessory to its
publication. The truth only came out in the course of
the author’s trial at Geneva in the year 1553. Basle
had the credit for a time of having hatched the cockatrice;
and that the charge was taken seriously to heart
appears from a letter of Œcolampadius to Bucer
which has been preserved.</p>

<p>The Swiss churches, as is known, were not all at
one with Luther and his followers upon some of the
transcendental topics of their common faith; and
Servetus in his book having attacked the Doctrine of
Justification by Faith&mdash;the leading feature in Luther’s
theology, in terms neither complimentary nor respectful,
the Switzers were anxious to have the great head
of the Reform movement informed that they had
nothing in common with the Serveto, alias Rev&eacute;s, of
the book ‘De Trinitatis Erroribus,’ and that it had
not fallen from any of the presses of their country.
In his letter to Bucer dated from Basle, August 5,
1531, Œcolampadius informs him that ‘several of
their friends had seen Servetus’s book and were beyond
measure offended with it.’ ‘I wish you would write to
Luther,’ he continues, ‘and tell him it was printed
elsewhere than at Basle, and without any privity of
ours. It is surely a piece of consummate impudence
in the writer to say that the Lutherans are ignorant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
of what Justification really means. Passing many
things by, I fancy he must belong to the sect of the
Photinians, or to some other I know not what.
Unless he be put down by the doctors of our church, it
will be the worse for us. I pray you of all others to
keep watch; and if you find no better or earlier opportunity,
be particular in your report to the Emperor
in excusing us and our churches from the breaking in
among us of this wild beast. He indeed abuses
everything in his way of viewing it; and to such
lengths does he go that he disputes the coeternity and
consubstantiality of the Father and the Son&mdash;he would
even have the man Christ to be the Son of God in the
usual natural way.’<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<p>Bucer having perused the ‘De Trinitatis Erroribus’
would seem to have been excessively disturbed or
scandalised by its contents. Known as a man of a
perfectly humane disposition in a general way, he is
now violent even to slaying. Denouncing its author
from the pulpit, he is said to have declared that the
writer of such a book deserved to be disembowelled
and torn in pieces! Yet was not Martin B&uuml;tzer always
of this savage way of thinking. In a Preface and
Postscript to an early work&mdash;a translation by a friend,
of Augustin’s Treatise ‘on the Duty of the Ruler
in matters of Religion,’<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> he is as mercifully disposed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
towards the erring as could be desired. They are to
be prayed for, instructed, and it may be punished, but
it is to be mildly; they are never to be put to death.
He refers to his ‘Dialogues’ in which the subject is
treated at length.</p>

<p>Luther, too, must have read the work, and it is
not a little interesting to us to be made aware from
what he says himself that he, like others of the
Reformers, as well as Michael Servetus, had been
troubled with doubts about the conformity of the
orthodox Trinitarian dogma with the dictates of simple
reason. In the Table-Talk&mdash;Tisch-Reden&mdash;of 1532, he
refers to what he characterises as ‘a fearfully wicked
book&mdash;ein greulich b&ouml;s Buch&mdash;’ which had lately come
out against the doctrine of the holy Trinity. ‘Visionaries
like the writer,’ says Doctor Martin, ‘do not
seem to fancy that other folks as well as they may
have had temptations on this subject. But the sting
did not hold; I set the word of God and the Holy
Ghost against my thoughts and got free.’ Luther as
usual imagined that the doubts he felt were inspired by
the Devil, instead of by God, through the reason given
him for his guidance.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

<p>But of all his contemporaries Melanchthon appears
to have been more taken with the work on Trinitarian
Error than any other of the leading Reformers; and
he is much more outspoken in expressing his opinion
of the incomprehensible and really unscriptural nature
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
of the dogma which it is the gist of Servetus’s book to
impugn. To one of his friends he begins his letter
by telling him ‘that he has been reading Servetus a
great deal&mdash;<i>Servetum multum lego</i>&mdash;though I am well
aware of the fanatical nature of the man. In his
derisive treatment of Justification he sees nothing but
the <i>quality</i> of Augustin; and he plainly raves when,
misinterpreting the text of the Old and New Testament,
he denies to the Prophets the Holy Spirit.
I also think he does injustice both to Tertullian and
Iren&aelig;us, when, treating of the Word, he makes them
question its being an hypostasis. But I have little
doubt that great controversies will one day arise on
this subject, as well as on the distinction of the two
natures in Christ.’<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<p>To Camerarius, another friend, he writes: ‘You
ask me what I think of Servetus? I see him indeed
sufficiently sharp and subtle in disputation, but I do
not give him credit for much depth. He is possessed,
as it seems to me, of confused imaginations, and his
thoughts are not well matured on the subjects he
discusses. He manifestly talks foolishness when he
speaks of Justification. Περὶ τῆς τρίαδος&mdash;on the subject
of the Trinity&mdash;you know, I have always feared that
serious difficulties would one day arise. Good God! to
what tragedies will not these questions give occasion
in times to come: εἴ ἐστιν ὑπόστασις ὁ λὀγος&mdash;is the
Logos an hypostasis? εἴ ἐστιν ὑπόστασις τὸ πνεῦμα&mdash;is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
the Holy Ghost an hypostasis? For my own
part I refer me to those passages of Scripture that bid
us call on Christ, which is to ascribe divine honours to
him, and find them full of consolation.’<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<p>This is surely very candid and beautiful. But the
spirit of the Prophet of Nazareth did not always find
such a resting place as it did in the heart and mind of
Philip Schwarzerde, though he too could forget himself
and approve of violence, as we shall see, when
certain beliefs which he held sacred and thought it a
public duty to profess were assailed. At this time,
however, on this occasion, he is in his proper placable
frame of mind and continues thus: ‘I find it after all of
little use to inquire too curiously into that which properly
constitutes the nature of a <i>Person</i>, and into that
wherein and whereby persons are distinguished from
one another. It is very provoking that in Epiphanius,
except a few trifling passages, we have nothing from
the days when the same questions were agitated by
Paul of Samosata&mdash;nothing in fact whence we might
know what was thought of Paul’s opinions at the time,
and of what mind were they who condemned him. I
am even greatly distressed when I think of such
negligence on the part of the hierarchs of the age of
this Paul, as well as of times more near our own.’
When writing thus Melanchthon plainly sympathised
more with Paul of Samosata and his opinions than he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
would have liked to acknowledge at a later period of
his life; for he, too, like so many who become narrow
and intolerant in age, was liberal enough when younger,
and in the earlier editions of his ‘Loci Theologici’
could speak of the Holy Spirit as nothing more than
an ‘Afflatus of Deity.’</p>

<p>The above extracts from confidential letters seem
to show that Melanchthon was not himself quite clear as
to the sense in which a Trinity of the Godhead was to
be understood; a state of mind shared in, unless we
much mistake, by more than one among the most influential
men of the Swiss Churches, by none more
certainly than by Calvin, their great head, himself, as
we shall show. Melanchthon indeed in his next letter to
the same friend, speaking of Servetus’s assumption that
Tertullian did not think the Logos an hypostasis&mdash;a
distinct substantial reality&mdash;proceeds:&mdash;‘To me Tertullian
seems to think on this subject as we do in public&mdash;<i>quod
publice sentimus</i>, and not in the way Servetus
interprets him. But of these things more hereafter
when we meet.’ Melanchthon would not therefore trust
in writing, even to an intimate friend, all he thought on
the subject of the Trinity; and truly there is matter
enough when critically scanned in the first edition of
his best-known work&mdash;‘The Loci Theologici’ of 1521&mdash;that
puts him out of the pale of orthodox Trinitarianism.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span></p>

<p>Neither was Joannes Œcolampadius without something
of a fellow feeling for Servetus, although he repudiated
his conclusions. Writing to Martin Bucer on
July 18, 1531, shortly after the publication of the work
on Trinitarian misconception, he informs his friend
that he had heard from Capito of Strasburg, who tells
him that the book is for sale among them there, and
has rejoiced some of the enemies of the Church, as it
will also afford matter of gratulation to the Papists of
France when they see that writings of the kind are
suffered to be published in Germany. ‘Read the book,’
continues the writer, ‘and tell me what you think of it.
Were I not busy with my Job, I should be disposed to
answer it myself; but I must leave this duty to another
with more leisure at command. Our Senate have forbidden
the Spaniard’s book to be sold here. They
have asked my opinion of its merits, and I have said
that as the writer does not acknowledge the coeternity
of the Son, I can in no wise approve of it as a whole,
although it contains much else that is good&mdash;<i>Etiamsi
multa alia bona scribat</i>.’<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p>In the days of Philip Melanchthon and Joannes
Œcolampadius we therefore see that men had <i>private</i>
opinions on subjects to which they were committed by
their subscriptions, which differed we know not how
widely from their public professions, precisely as among
the ancients, and ourselves at the present time:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
culture would still seem to make an esoteric and an
exoteric doctrine a necessity of existence.</p>

<p>Made aware, as we are by these letters of the
Reformers, that Servetus’s book was causing a considerable
stir both in Switzerland and Germany, it
seems, in so far as we have ascertained, to have been
entirely neglected by the Roman Catholics of these
lands as well as of France. We have searched in vain
for any notice of it in French theological writings of
the period; neither have we been able to discover,
though condemned and ordered to be suppressed by
the Emperor Charles V. when brought under his notice
by Cochl&aelig;us and Quintana at Ratisbon, that it figures
at any early date on the Roman Index of prohibited
books. There are good reasons for believing, nevertheless,
that Servetus’s book on Trinitarian Misconception
had a large amount of influence on Italian ground.
It had been sent south in numbers; and aware of this
Melanchthon took it upon him by-and-by to address
the Senate of Venice on the subject, informing them
that a highly objectionable work was for sale among
them, and suggesting that measures should be taken
for its suppression. The Sozzini, uncle and nephew&mdash;L&aelig;lius
and Faustus Socinus&mdash;and their followers, the
Unitarians, have consequently been seen as the disciples
of Servetus, though it may be that they were so
only indirectly; for Servetus himself, as we shall find,
declares that he does not deny a kind of trinity in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
unity of God. But his trinity is <i>modal</i> or <i>formal</i>, not
<i>real</i> or <i>personal</i> in the usual sense of the word.</p>

<p>If overlooked by theologians of the Latin races,
the work of our author appears to have attracted all
the more attention from the men of Teutonic descent
who had espoused the cause of the Reformation. In
their ranks in the early period of the sixteenth century
the intelligence of Europe, in so far as the religious
question was concerned, seems to have been concentrated.
They took pains to inform themselves generally
on all that was going on in the republic of letters, and
in so much of it very particularly as bore on the subject
they had most at heart. It is among the Swiss
and German Reformers consequently that we find any
particular notice taken of Servetus’s book on Trinitarian
Error. They alone show themselves scandalised
by the opinions of its author and his style of expressing
them, jealous too, it might seem, at the intrusion of a
mere layman into their domain&mdash;a phenomenon as yet
perfectly unheard of, and startled further by the advances
they discovered in the book upon all that they, as inheritors
of apostolic traditions in common with their
Roman Catholic brethren (from whom in matters of
Dogma they differed so little), regarded as the truth.
Paul of Tarsus preaching his own independent gospel
to the Gentiles, proclaiming the universality of the
fatherhood of God, the nothingness of Circumcision,
and, in opposition to the whole Levitical code, that all
days were alike holy and that it was not what went
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
into the mouth of a man that defiled him, could scarcely
have been more ominous to the intolerant Nazarene
Church of Jerusalem than was the appearance of this
daring innovator upon the religious stage of Germany.
His book, everywhere freely sold in the first instance,
must have been read by everyone of liberal education,
though it became so scarce ere long, denounced
and decried as it must have been universally by the
ministers, that twenty years afterwards a copy, most
pressingly wanted, and eagerly sought after, was nowhere
to be found in Switzerland; so effectually had
zealotry succeeded in having it committed to the
flames!</p>

<p>Strasburg and Basle, however, must have been the
emporiums whence the supplies of the ‘De Erroribus
Trinitatis’ were sent forth; for after its author’s visit to
the capital of Elsass and his happy delivery of this the
first-born of his genius at Hagenau, we find him again
in Basle and making himself obnoxious to Œcolampadius
as before. Writing what we must presume to
be a second or third letter to the Reformer, and complimenting
him on what he is pleased to style his
correspondent’s clear apprehension of Luther’s doctrine
of Justification, Servetus goes on to make a personal
request. ‘Somewhat fearful of writing to you again,’
he says, ‘lest I should molest you still more than I
have already done, I yet venture to ask of you not to
interfere with my sending the books to France which
I have with me here, the book-fair of Lyons drawing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
near; for you of all men are better entitled than any
one else to pronounce an opinion upon things unheard
of until now. If you think it better that I should not
remain here, I shall certainly take my leave; only, you
are not to think that I go as a fugitive. God knows
I have been sincere in all I have written, although
my crude style perchance displeases you. I did not
imagine you would take offence at what I say of the
Lutherans; especially when from your own mouth I
heard you declare you were of opinion that Luther had
treated Charity in too off-hand a style; adding, as you
did, that folks were charitable mostly when they had
nothing else to think of. Melanchthon, too, as you
know, affirms that God has no regard for charity.
Such sayings, believe me, are more hurtful to the soul
than anything I have ever written. And this all the
more as I see that you are not agreed among yourselves
on the subject of faith; for with my own ears
I have heard you say one thing, which is otherwise
declared by doctor Paulus, otherwise by Luther, and
yet otherwise by Melanchthon;<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> and of this I admonished
you in your own house; but you would not
hear me.</p>

<p>‘Your rule for proving the Spirit, I think, deceives
you; for, if in your own mind there be any fear, or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
doubt, or confusion, you cannot judge truly of me;
and this the more because, although you know me in
error in one thing, you ought not, therefore, to condemn
me in others, else there were none who should
escape burning a thousand times over. This truth is
forced on us on all hands, most especially perhaps by
the example of the Apostles, who sometimes erred.
And, then, you do not condemn Luther in every particular,
although you are well aware that he is mistaken
in some things. I have myself entreated you to
instruct me, which, however, you have not done. It is
surely an infirmity of our human nature that none of
us see our own faults, and so commonly look on those
who differ from us as impious persons or impostors.
I entreat you, for God’s sake, to spare my name and
reputation. I say nothing of others who are not interested
in the questions between us. You say that I
would have no one punished or put to death, though
all were thieves alike; but I call the omnipotent God
to witness that this is not my opinion; nay, I scout
any such conclusion. If I have spoken at any time on
the subject (the punishment proper for heresy), it was
because I saw it as a most serious matter to put men
to death on the ground of mistake in interpreting the
Scriptures; for do we not read that even the elect may
err? You know full well that I have not treated my
subject in so indifferent or indiscreet a manner as to
deserve entire rejection at your hands. You make
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
little yourself of speaking of the Holy Spirit as an
angel, but think it a great crime in me when I say that
the Son of God was a man.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="n10">‘Farewell.</span><br />
‘<span class="smcap">Michael Serveto.</span>’<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a><br />
</p>

<p>This letter, so characteristic of the writer, is full of
interest even at the present hour. Servetus would
have Œcolampadius instruct him; but the invariable
complaint of all with whom he came in contact was that
he could never be made to receive instruction; in other
words, secure in his own conclusions, he thought his
would-be instructors mistaken in theirs. And this,
indeed, for good or ill, is characteristic of all who impress
their age, and show themselves leaders in art, in
science, in policy, or religion. Genius measures with
its own rod, and is its own guide on the way it goes.
The world is not moved by men who have all they
own from teachers.</p>

<p>But especially worthy of note is the remark our
writer makes on the serious responsibility men assume
when they put each other to death for mistaken interpretations
of Scripture. Had no scholar in modern
times before Servetus come to so great and charitable
a conclusion, we should still have to hallow the
memory of the man who, more than three hundred
years ago, had the head and the heart to proclaim
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
so great a principle, in the enforcement of which in all
its aspects the better spirits of the world still find such
opposition; though it is not now by the infliction of
death that bigotry and intolerance revenge themselves
on their victims, the advocates of freethought and outspoken
religious criticism.</p>

<p>A good deal has been said, by its author as well
as others, of the crude style of the book on Trinitarian
Error. But this to us seems the least of its faults&mdash;the
language is generally simple enough, not Ciceronian
certainly, but the meaning, save where the writer probably
did not quite understand himself, is not doubtful.
As a composition, it is the arrangement that is most
defective. The parts have so little either of coherence
or sequence, that of the seven books or chapters
into which it is divided, the last, as it seems, might
advantageously have been made the first. For there
it is, and not until the penultimate page of the entire
treatise is attained, that the key to the writer’s most
important conclusions is discovered. ‘Two fundamental
rules or principles,’ he says, ‘are to be steadily
kept in view:&mdash;1st, That the nature of God cannot be
conceived as divisible; and 2nd, That that which is
accidental to the nature of anything is disposition.’
The corollary he would have to follow from these premisses
or postulates being, that the orthodox idea
of a Trinity, <i>i.e.</i>, of the existence of three distinct
persons or entities in the unity of the Godhead, is an
impossibility, and so a fundamental religious error. As
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
Servetus himself believed in God, and acknowledged a
Son of God and a Holy Spirit&mdash;finding mention of
these in the Scriptures, no word of which would he
overlook, though putting his own interpretation on all
they say&mdash;he held that the Son and Holy Ghost, in
consonance with his Second Principle, must be what
he calls <i>dispositions</i>, or <i>dispensations</i> of the one eternal
indivisible Deity&mdash;in other words, manifestations of
God in the world.</p>

<p>The ‘Idea of God’ to which Servetus had attained
is unquestionably grand. ‘God,’ he says, ‘is
eternal, one and indivisible, and in himself inscrutable,
but making his being known in and through creation;
so that not only is every living, but every lifeless
thing, an aspect of the Deity. Before creation was,
God was; but neither was he Light, nor Word, nor
Spirit, but some ineffable thing else&mdash;<i>sed quid aliud
ineffabile</i>&mdash;these, Light, Word, Spirit, being mere dispensations,
modes or expressions of pre-existing Deity.
(‘Dial.’ i. 4.) God, he says, has no proper nature; for
this would imply a beginning; and <i>before</i> and <i>after</i> are
terms that have no significance when they are referred
to God. Though God knew what to man would be
a future, his own prescience was without respect to
<i>time</i>, and involved no such necessity as is implied in
<i>choice</i>. God, he continues, can be defined by nothing
that pertains to body; he created the world of himself,
of his substance, and, as essence, he actuates&mdash;<i>essentiat</i>&mdash;all
things. (‘Dial.’ ii.) The Spirit of God is the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
universal agent; it is in the air we breathe, and is the
very breath of life; it moves the heavenly bodies;
sends out the winds from their quarters; takes up
and stores the water in the clouds, and pours it out as
rain to fertilise the earth. God is therefore ever distinct
from the universe of things, and when we speak
of the Word, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, we but
speak of the presence and power of God projected into
creation, animating and actuating all that therein is,
man more especially than aught else; ‘the Holy Spirit
I always say is the motion of God in the soul of man,
and that out of man there cannot properly be said to
be any Holy Spirit.’ (‘De Trin. Err.’ f. 85, b, and
‘Dial.’ ii.) This is obviously a statement of what may
be called the Exo-pantheistic principle in very broad
terms, akin to what we find in the Grecian mythology
and certain schools of philosophy; other than the
Endo-pantheistic conception of later times&mdash;the Causa
Principio et Uno of Giordano Bruno,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> the Substantia
of Spinoza, the Universum or Kosmos of Goethe,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
Hegel, Humboldt, Schopenhauer, D. F. Strauss,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> &amp;c. It
is the Principle inseparable from the mighty All as
from the individual Atom, or Pantheism proper.</p>

<p>We shall, by-and-by, find our author, on his
Geneva trial, damaging his case and exciting, we may
imagine, the astonishment of the unlettered among
his judges, by the assertion of his pantheistic notions,
and arousing the needless, and it may even be, the
assumed ire of Calvin&mdash;for he was familiar with the
idea, having said himself that he only objected to call
Nature, God, because it was a hard and improper expression&mdash;<i>quia
est dura et impropria loquutio</i>.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<p>Criticising the first verse of the Fourth Gospel: ‘In
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with
God, and the Word was God,’ Servetus maintains that
the Greek λὀγος, translated Word with us, does not
designate an entity but utterance or speech, as appears
by its etymology, derived as it is from λἐγω, to speak,
to discourse. Of the Word of God, therefore, to make
the Son of God is to do as did the heathen, who
turned ideas or abstractions into mythical beings&mdash;Echo
into a Nymph, Fortitude into Minerva, &amp;c., and
so to bring discord and dissidence upon the truths of
Scripture. (‘De Tr. Err.’ f. 47, b.) The Word spoken
by God in the beginning implies fore-thought, fore-knowledge;
whence it is characterised as Wisdom,
‘that was from the beginning or ever the earth was.
Under the mystery of the Word, the older apostolic
tradition understood a certain dispensation whereby
God willed to reveal himself to mankind. The Word
of God therefore is equivalent to the Act of God; and
even as Light came of the spoken word, so too came
Creation, so too came Man.’ In this way, says our
author, do we readily comprehend the expression of
John: ‘The Word was made flesh,’ and learn in what
sense Christ is truly the Word: ‘He is, as it were, the
voice of God enunciating to mankind the will of the
Universal Father.’ (Ib. f. 49 b.) The Word, consequently,
is nothing different from God, but is God
himself evoking all things, Christ among the number
in the fulness of time. If a reasonable meaning is to
be attached to mystical language, it seems difficult to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
imagine any more satisfactory interpretation than this
of Servetus, with which we see that of a distinguished
liberal divine of our own day essentially to agree, as he
says: ‘The Logos of the New Testament means not
only the Word as translated, but Reason, Intelligence,
communicating itself in thought and speech. It is
the divine wisdom which was from the beginning in
the mind of God made manifest in time.’<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></p>

<p>The title <i>Son of God</i>, again, Servetus maintains is
nowhere to be found in the Scriptures otherwise applied
than to a man&mdash;to the man Jesus in particular;
and the word <i>Person</i> he insists is always to be understood
in the sense of the Greek προσῶπον and the
Latin <i>persona</i>, a mask, an appearance, and not any <i>real</i>
or individual thing. With this style of exposition the
Reformers could of course by no means agree. They
had adopted all the symbols of their predecessors of
the Church of Rome; and it seems to have been
Servetus’ insistance on his own divergent interpretation
of the language of John and the creeds that more
especially aroused the enmity of Œcolampadius,
Bucer, Calvin, and the rest, they holding that to be
accounted a Christian it was necessary not only to
acknowledge Christ to be the Son of God, which
Servetus was quite ready to do, in the way he understood
the filiation, but to acknowledge him to be the
Logos or Word of St. John, consubstantial and coeternal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
with the Father&mdash;which, to Servetus, was impossible.
It is probable that the way and manner
in which in any conceivable fashion such coeternity
and consubstantiality could be apprehended was among
the topics on which Servetus craved enlightenment
from Œcolampadius; and as he could obtain none,
pique and personal dislike, opposition and enmity, took
the place of dispassionate and friendly discussion;
precisely as happened in later years and mainly on
the same subjects between our author and Calvin.</p>

<p>In his attempt to develope and explain his own
conception of the mystery of the Trinity&mdash;for it is a
mistake to suppose that Servetus was opposed to
something of the kind&mdash;he does not set out like the
writer of the Fourth Gospel from the transcendental
Word, but starts with the historical Jesus, the man,
the reputed son of Joseph the Carpenter, but verily
or naturally, as he says, the Son of God. To this son
the name Jesus was given at the time of his circumcision,
the title Christ being conferred by his disciples;
whilst it was only at his baptism that he was
designated Son of God. The Holy Spirit and power
of the Highest overshadowing the Virgin Mary, and
acting in her as generator or generative dew, Jesus
the Son of God and her Son was engendered. It is
not the Word consequently, but Jesus the Son of Mary
who is a Son of God: ‘The holy thing that shall be
born of thee,’ says the angel addressing the Virgin,
‘shall be called a Son of God.’ ‘They therefore
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
plainly err,’ says Servetus, ‘who speak of the Word
as the Son of God: the man Jesus was the Son of God,
not the Word; the man Jesus engendered, as stated
above, by God in the womb of the Virgin.’ ‘All the
Trinitarian errors,’ he concludes, ‘have arisen from
not understanding the true nature of the Incarnation.’</p>

<p>When he comes to speak of the Holy Ghost,
Servetus unhappily forgets what is due to the discussion
of a subject that has engaged the serious
thoughts of so many pious men. He would seem to
have seen some portions of the catholic Christian
dogma as so unreasonable that they were even open to
ridicule; and this leads him to the use of improper
language. The Holy Ghost, he maintains, is never
spoken of save confusedly in the Scriptures, the term
being applied variously now to an angel, now to the
soul of man, and again to nothing more than wind or
breath (Ib. f. 22, a.). The Hebrew word <i>Ruach</i>, of
which spirit or wind is a translation, has indeed a still
greater variety of meanings. On a subject so indefinite
and undefined as the Holy Spirit, we cannot
wonder that Œcolampadius in one of his letters should
declare he can make nothing of what Servetus says on
the matter&mdash;‘<i>dicit nescio quid</i>&mdash;he says I know not
what.’ This much, however, we do make out as our
author’s opinion, viz.: that the Holy Spirit is nowhere
spoken of in Scripture as a distinct and independent
entity, but always as a motion, an agency, an afflatus
of God or the power of God,&mdash;a view in which he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
certainly had Melanchthon as his predecessor: ‘<i>Nec
aliud spiritus sanctus est nisi viva Dei voluntas et
agitatio.</i>’ (‘Loci Theol.’ p. 128, ed. 1521.)</p>

<p>Referring to the dogma of the ‘Two Natures,’
Servetus holds that this, too, is founded in error. ‘To
speak of the <i>Nature</i> of God,’ he says, ‘is absurd; for
the word nature can only apply to something created,
something born (from the Latin <i>natus</i>). But God is
from Eternity. For my own part,’ he proceeds, ‘I
never take nature to signify aught but the thing to
which the term is applied&mdash;the nature of a thing is the
thing itself. To use the word nature in connection
with the name of God is, therefore, to speak of God
himself. And so of the Son of God: that which was an
idea, image, or type of the Son in the mind of God, when
the Word was made flesh, became or was Christ, Reality
then superseding Idea (‘De Tr. Er.’ f. 92). There
was consequently no aggregate of two natures or two
different things in Christ; he was one entity or person,
in the usual sense of the word.’ Servetus very inconsistently,
as it seems at first sight, often speaks of the
man Jesus as God. But he can do so only on the same
ground as Cyrus in the Bible, Augustus C&aelig;esar, and
other rulers, are called <i>Dii</i> or <i>Divi</i>&mdash;gods. The Son
of God, to Servetus, in conformity with the pantheistic
idea, can only be an aspect or <i>Mode</i> of the One God.
If this be not his meaning, I know not what it is.</p>

<p>We have said above that Servetus is not opposed
to the idea of a Trinity of dispositions, powers, or properties
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
in the Deity, but only denies such a trinity of
persons or entities as is embodied in the symbols of
orthodox Christianity. It is not unimportant, therefore,
to learn what the precise idea was which he had
of the threefold state he acknowledged as extant in the
essence of God. His words are these: ‘<i>Tres sunt
admirandi Dei dispositiones in quarum qualibet divinitas
relucet, ex quo sanissime Trinitatem intelligere posses</i>,
&amp;c.&mdash;There are three admirable dispositions in God,
in each of which divinity appears, and from which you
may satisfactorily understand the Trinity. For the
Father is the one God, from whom proceed certain
dispensations. But these imply no distinction into
separate entities. By the economy of God&mdash;<i>Dei</i>
οἰκονομίαν&mdash;they are no more than so many forms or
aspects of Deity; for the divineness that is in the
Father, the same is in the Son, and in the Holy
Ghost.’</p>

<p>In another passage, he asserts his belief in a Trinity
still more distinctly: ‘I concede one person of the
Father, another person of the Son, another person of
the Holy Ghost: three persons in one God, and this is
the true Trinity.’ (Ib. f. 64, b.) Had we not our
author’s explanation of the way in which he understands
the word <i>person</i>, this would make his conception,
in so far, not different from the orthodox interpretation
of the mystery. But his language here must be
regretted, for it is misleading, the word <i>person</i> with
Servetus not signifying, as we have seen, any real or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
individual entity distinct from other entities, but property,
appearance, or outward manifestation. The
second and third persons, therefore, as understood by
Servetus, are to be thought of as dispositions or modes
of God, the universal Father, and not as individuals or
persons in the usual acceptation of these words, though
of them it is that distinct personages have been made,
and spoken of as being at once God and other than
God, as being three and yet no more than one.</p>

<p>In sequence to this, our author goes on to say that
‘he will not make use of the word Trinity, which is not
to be found in Scripture, and only seems to perpetuate
philosophical error. It were well, indeed,’ he continues,
‘that all distinction of persons in the one God were
henceforth abandoned and rooted out of the minds of
men’ (Ib. f. 64, b.); words in which we see reason
getting the better of subserviency to the letter of Scripture,
and putting an extinguisher, as it were, upon his
own as well as other vain attempts to give a rational
explanation of the mystical Neo-Platonic Logos-Doctrine
of the Fourth Gospel, of which the Trinitarian
Church-Dogma is the outcome. Hampered, however,
by the idea that everything in the Bible is the word of
God, Servetus insists on trying to find, for himself and
his readers, something like an acceptable interpretation
of the leading words of the Imaginative Mystical Discourse
entitled the Gospel according to John. In this
he fails, as might have been anticipated; and then, his
eyes being opened to the fact, he has nothing for it but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
to conclude that the orthodox Trinitarian mystery were
well discarded from the thoughts and the beliefs of
man. ‘To believe, however,’ he continues, ‘suffices, it
is said; but what folly to believe aught that cannot be
understood, that is impossible in the nature of things,
and that may even be looked on as blasphemous! Can
it be that mere confusion of mind is to be assumed as
an adequate object of faith?’ (Ib. f. 33, b.)</p>

<p>The Trinitarian doctrine of dogmatic Christianity
Servetus held to have been a great obstacle to the
spread of the religion of Christ. Opposed to the conception
of the Oneness of Deity to which the Jews had
finally attained, the religious system in which it was
made so prominent an element, could not possibly be
accepted by them; neither, on the same ground, could
it be received by Islam; for Mahomet, whilst he
acknowledged Jesus as a prophet and power in the
world, born of a Virgin, too, like other distinguished
individuals, in some incomprehensible manner, never
for a moment thought of him as the Son of God; for
‘God,’ says he, ‘as he is not engendered, so neither
does he engender.’</p>

<p>But it is not in connexion with the subject of the
Trinity alone that Servetus shows the advances he had
made on his age in the sphere of Biblical exposition.
Commenting on the text, ‘No man hath ascended up to
heaven but he who came down from heaven’ (John iii.
13), he says: ‘It is the spiritual heaven that is here
to be understood, and this exists wherever Christ is;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
“to ascend to heaven” means no more than to discourse
of heavenly things. “He that hath seen me hath seen
the Father,” says the text (Ib. xiv. 9), i.e., says our expositor,
‘he who appreciates the priceless treasures of
Christ’s love easily attains to a knowledge of God the
Father. But how should an invisible, intangible
Word give us to know God?’ (‘De Tr. Err.’ f. 46
<i>et seq.</i>)</p>

<p>There are others among the accepted doctrines of
the reformed Churches which, as repudiated by Servetus
and so arraying the whole of their adherents against
him and influencing his fate, require a passing notice
at our hands. Justification by Faith, for instance, he
maintains, comes not by belief in the merits or sufferings
of Christ, but by belief in his worth or dignity as
Son of God. On this ground, he says, the Lutherans
do not understand what Justification really is. It is by
belief of the kind he specifies, however, that we show
our obedience to God, accept the new covenant instead
of the old law, become the children of our heavenly
Father, and have the Holy Spirit imparted to us.
Such belief is, in fact, the very kernel of the Christian
dispensation, and that on which the new covenant of
grace reposes. It is the real rock on which Peter was
to build the Church, against which the gates of hell
should not prevail. But as hell does seem to have got
the upper hand, he adds, we can only conclude that
neither the Church on the rock nor the true Faith is now
to be found among us. The Lutheran Justification by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
Faith, in a word, is mere magical fascination and folly
(f. 82-84, Conf. ‘Ep. ad Calvin.’ xiii.).</p>

<p>But Faith, even the most fervent, is not yet sufficient
for salvation. The Justification thereby attained is still
no more than negative in kind; to become positive, it
must be associated with Love, i.e., with Charity in the
widest sense of the word; with the Love, that is the fulfilment
of the law, whereby alone do we secure for ourselves
treasures in heaven. Faith is the entrance, Charity
the sanctuary&mdash;<i>Fides ostium, Charitas perfectio</i>; and
there is a fine passage in the ‘Christianismi Restitutio’
(p. 349), comparable in some sort to Paul’s eloquent
outburst on the excellence of that much misused sentiment.
When Servetus speaks of Charity, therefore, it
is not the eleemosynary idea of his day that is meant,
with its mendicant friars, its convent doles, and its engendered
sloth and beggary; neither is it the mistaken
view of later days, which gives indolence and improvidence
a legal claim on industry and thrift. It is of
the nobler, truer kind that, beside good works, gives
man a right to think and to speak unfettered, and forbids
him to fancy that his brother is damned for
divergency in theological opinion.</p>

<p>To the leading Calvinistic doctrines of Predestination
and Election, involving as they do fettered instead
of free will, Servetus is still more violently opposed than
to the Lutheran Justification by Faith. ‘In your fatal,
not to say fatuous, necessity of all things, or your servile
will,’ says he, at a later period in his life, ‘there is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
a certain show of folly, seeing that you would have a
man do that which you must know he cannot do. You
speak of free acts, yet tell us there is no such thing as
free action. And it is absurd in you to derive the
servile will you abet from this: that it is God who acts
in us. Truly God does act in us, and in such wise that
we act freely. He acts in us so that we understand
and will and pursue. Even as all things consist essentially
in God, so do all acts proceed essentially from
him. But the power in us to do is one thing, the
necessity of doing is another; and though God may
deal with us as the potter deals with his clay, it does
not follow that we are nothing more than clay, and
have no power of action in ourselves.’ (Ib f. 79, b, et
‘Epist. ad Calvinum,’ xxii.)</p>

<p>Another of the most essential doctrines underlying
Pauline Christianity, original sin, is made little of by
Servetus. Although I spent much time in reading his
books, I do not appear to have made a note of more
than one or two passages in which he refers to that
subject; and when he does, it is by the way rather than
more particularly. It is on the necessity of faith in
Christ, as he understands the Sonship, that he dwells
continually, making of this the prime factor in his
scheme of restored Christianity. ‘This faith it is,’
says he, ‘that first makes us aware of our poverty, of
our misery; for if we believe that Christ is the Son of
God and the Saviour of the world, we already assume
that the world is sinful, and requires saving’ (‘Chr.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
Rest.’ p. 349). He does not refer particularly to what
is called ‘the Fall,’ neither does he say very pointedly
how the world came into the sorry plight in which he
admits that he finds it. The reason usually assigned
must have appeared unsatisfactory to an understanding
so clear as that of Servetus, when unclouded by fancies
of his own creating; but we can hardly think he mends
matters by ascribing the origin of sin to heaven and the
rebellion of the angels, as he does, instead of to the
earth and Adam’s disobedience. Far from maintaining
that the heart of man is corrupt and evil by nature, he
holds that the cause of good works and well-doing is
proper and spontaneous to the individual, who is only
answerable for his own sin, not for the sin of another.
Faith in Christ, therefore, as the naturally-begotten Son
of God; Charity, in which are comprised all the virtues,
and a good life, in so far as we can make it out, form
the backbone of Servetus’s Christianity, as it is
unfolded in his earliest work on ‘Current Misconceptions
of the Trinity.’<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a>

<h2 id="BOOK_I_CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="hang">THE AUTHORITIES OF BASLE TAKE NOTICE OF HIS BOOK.
HE WRITES TWO DIALOGUES BY WAY OF APPENDIX TO
IT AND LEAVES SWITZERLAND.</p>

<p>Failing to make any impression on the Swiss and
German Reformers whose countenance he had been so
anxious to gain, we have seen Servetus in his letter to
Œcolampadius declaring his readiness to quit Basle, to
which he must have returned, if it were only not said
that he went as a fugitive, and giving something like
an engagement to his correspondent to review and,
reviewing, to modify or retract some things he had
said in his book. That some such engagement was
given we conclude from the letter of Œcolampadius
to the magistrates of Basle, to which we shall refer
immediately, and from which it would seem that it
was through the forbearance, if not even the more
friendly interference, of the Reformer that our author
escaped arrest and imprisonment at this time. The
seven books or chapters on erroneous ideas of the
Trinity had not fallen stillborn from the press;
neither had the presence of the writer in Basle passed
unobserved. The book being seen as heretical in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
highest degree by the ministers, the presence of its
writer among them was felt as matter of grievance by
both clergy and laity; so that the Civic Council held it
within the scope of their duties to take notice of the
innovator, of whom they heard so much that was discreditable,
and, by laying hands on him, either to make
him pay in person then and there, or to send him
away, like an infected bale, to spread his poison
elsewhere.</p>

<p>Previous to acting, however, they thought it would
be well to have the opinion of their chief Pastor,
Œcolampadius, on what had best be done, and so requested
him to advise with them on the subject. He
replied by a long letter in which he recapitulates
the chief topics discussed by Servetus in his treatise.
‘He, Œcolampadius, will do what he can to place the
good man’s views before them,&mdash;if indeed he may
venture to speak of the writer as a good man; for it
seems that he strives at times as much to darken the
light as to enlighten the darkness, mixing up incongruities
rashly and not seldom stopping short of contradicting
himself. He opposes the orthodox doctors
continually, and uses certain words in an arbitrary
and unusual sense. He denies the coeternity of the
Father and the Son, a doctrine hitherto held sacred by
all the Christian churches; and only recognises the
sonship from the moment of the engenderment, or
rather of the birth of Christ. He even derides the
idea of God having a son from eternity, and asks
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
whence the heavenly father had his wife, or whether
he were of both sexes in himself? He will only
recognise the eternity of the Son as an <i>Idea</i> in the
divine mind: the Son was to be, but was not yet, until
he appeared in the flesh. He will by no means concede
that the Word of St. John was the Christ; yet he
speaks of three persons in the one God; but it is with
glozing and an arbitrary meaning attached to the word
person, and with reasonings which, if they sometimes
make for his views, are at other times opposed to them,
he neither thinking nor speaking as do the apostles,
and wresting the words of the fathers&mdash;of Tertullian
and Iren&aelig;us especially&mdash;from the interpretation commonly
put upon them.</p>

<p>‘Along with all this and much more that is objectionable,
there are still some things in the book that
are good; nevertheless as a whole it could not but
offend me. God grant that the writer acknowledge
the rashness which has led him to speak so unadvisedly
as he has done of matters which transcend
our human intelligence, and that he may live to amend
what he has said. As to the book, it would be well
perhaps that it were either totally suppressed, or were
read by those only who are not likely to be hurt by
objectionable writings. The errors he has fallen into
acknowledged, <i>he will retract</i> in his writings&mdash;<i>retract&acirc;rit
scriptis</i>. Perhaps he was not himself aware of
their extent, or they were not seen by him as of such
importance as they are in fact. But I leave all to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
your prudence and discretion, humbly commending
myself and my work to your favour.’<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></p>

<p>If we are to understand the <i>retract&acirc;rit scriptis</i> of
the above as a promise from Servetus to retract in a
future work what he has said in his first, he certainly
did not keep his word in the ‘Dialogi de Trinitate,’<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a>
which he published in the course of the following year.
In the Preface to these dialogues, it is true, he informs
the candid reader that he retracts all he had ‘lately
written in the seven books of erroneous conceptions
concerning the Trinity, not because what I say there
is false, but because the work is imperfect and written
as it were by a child for children. I pray you nevertheless
to hold by so much as you find there that may
help you to understand the subjects discussed. All
that is barbarous, confused and faulty, ascribe to my
inexperience and the carelessness of the printer. I
would not that any Christian were offended by what I
say; for God is used sometimes to make known his
wisdom to the world by weak vessels. Look at the
thing itself, therefore, I pray you, and if you take
good heed, my stammering will prove no hindrance to
you.’</p>

<p>The reputed printer of Servetus’s Treatise and
Two Dialogues, Jo. Secerius, has no particular name as a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
typographer. But these little works are by no means
incorrectly printed; they show few typographical
errors&mdash;so few that they must almost certainly have
been read for press by the writer himself. The
printer therefore is not to be blamed for any shortcomings
of the kind referred to by the author&mdash;if there
be defect it is his own, and it was the matter not the
manner that had been found fault with. But the
Preface is apologetic in directions uncalled for, and is
meaningless in fact. Servetus did not think himself a
weak vessel; neither did he look on his work as the
work of a child for children; and as for any retractation
of his opinions, nothing seems to have been further
from his mind. On the contrary the mysticism of the
writer of the Fourth Gospel appears to have taken a
firmer hold of our author than it had done before, and
to have acted as fresh ferment to the mystical element
so abundant in his proper nature. There may be
modification of some of the views already enunciated,
but from none of them is there recession. The
opposition he met with from the leading Reformers
seems even to have added point and precision to his
writing. He is more outspoken than before, and is
still less chary in the kind of language he uses towards
opponents. The usual conception of a <i>partitioned</i>
Deity he declares to be simply blasphemous; they
who seriously entertain it are fools, and so blind that
were Christ to come among them now and declare he
was the Son of God, they would crucify him anew.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
The Dialogues, instead of any denial and retractation,
are a reiteration and defence of almost all he has said
in his first production; although, indeed, we do observe
that where he can he occasionally approximates somewhat
to more orthodox views; in that passage very
notably where he speaks of the Son being of the same
essence (homousios), and even consubstantial with the
Father. (‘Dial.’ i., f. <small>II</small>, b.) But these are really no
more than words set down under the varying impulses
of mind to which the writer gave way, and are deprived
of any meaning that might attach to them by something
that has either gone before or that comes immediately
after.</p>

<p>The discussion of Luther’s Justification by Faith, to
which it must be presumed his attention had been particularly
called by Œcolampadius as likely to be offensive
to the Lutherans, is renewed in the Dialogues;
and the writer is so far carried away by his own
exaggerated estimate of the mental condition implied in
faith or belief, that he seems even to accept <i>in toto</i> the
principle he would controvert. Though he is elsewhere
and ever so emphatic in praise of good works or
charity, we here find him not sparing in condemnation
of those who hope through their doings of any kind to
achieve salvation. Monks and nuns accordingly, who
sin more especially in this direction and who by the
assumption of peculiar habits and behaviour think to
make themselves agreeable to God, are an especial
abomination to him. Man, he declares, cannot be justified
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
by the observance of vows or rules of any kind;
for these are not written in the law of God, and in
themselves are without significance. ‘A most pestilent
thing it is, that Papal decrees and monastic vows are
assumed as means of salvation. When men bind
themselves by vows to particular observances, they
virtually declare that the salvation they have through
Christ is insufficient, and lay themselves fast in those
bonds of the law from which Christ came to set them
free.’</p>

<p>In spite of frequently recurring contradictions and
something that is objectionable on the score of taste,
we nevertheless think that no one, however little disposed
to abet Servetus’s general views, could peruse
these dialogues without coming to the conclusion that
the writer was a man of a sincerely pious nature, who
had read much, and reflected deeply, feeling it a necessity
of his nature to expend himself in the mystical
verbiage in which religious enthusiasm loves to robe
itself as in a sufficient and seemly garment.</p>

<p>The seven Books and two Dialogues on the Trinity
of Servetus have been spoken of as an attempt to hold
a middle course between the Roman Catholic and the
Reformed churches; and there may be something to
warrant such a conclusion from what is said in the
chapter ‘De Justitia Regni Christi.’ But Servetus’s
Trinity is of another kind from that of either the older
or the younger sister, and where not assimilable to the
Neoplatonic ideas of Philo, it followed from the Pantheistic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
principles which, like deep thinkers in general,
he had adopted. God to Servetus was the ἓν καὶ πᾶν,
the One and the All; and if at any time he speaks of
Christ as God, it is as a manifestation of the Divine
in human form&mdash;a <i>dispensation</i> in his own phraseology,
a <i>mode</i> in Spinozistic language. The Divine Unity, and
its manifestation in the world in infinite modes, may
be said to be the fundamental idea in the philosophical
as well as the theological system of Servetus.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a>

<h2 id="BOOK_I_CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="center">PARIS. ASSUMPTION OF THE NAME OF VILLENEUVE OR
VILLANOVANUS. ACQUAINTANCE WITH CALVIN.</p>

<p>His indifferent reception by the German and Swiss
Reformers must have satisfied Servetus that there was
no abiding place for him among them. He was doubtless
disappointed and not a little disconcerted by the
treatment he met with at their hands. He had come
as a light-bringer, as a fellow striver for the Truth
through independent reading of the Scriptures.
Studious and learned; smitten with divine philosophy;
emancipated from the fetters of the church of Rome;
tolerant and charitable, he doubtless thought that the
liberal studies in Humanity and the Greek letters in
which he knew the Reformers excelled, must as a matter
of course have imparted to them something of the
liberality and comprehensiveness he felt in himself.
Face to face with their leaders in Basle and Strasburg,
however, he was undeceived; and when he saw that
his book on Trinitarian Error, instead of bringing him
fame and friends, earned him nothing but evil report
and enemies, and might even compromise his personal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
safety, there was nothing left for him but to pack up
and begone.</p>

<p>He must have quitted Switzerland immediately
after writing his letter to Œcolampadius, and in all
likelihood taken up his quarters at Hagenau, where
he lived quietly for some weeks or months engaged
in writing and supervising the printing of the ‘Two
Dialogues,’ with which and the concluding anathema
against all tyrants of the church, as a parting shot,
he went on his way to France, reaching Paris towards
the end of 1532. He had in fact made the German-speaking
parts of Switzerland and Elsass where he
was known, too hot for him, to use a familiar phrase;
and the parts where French was the mother tongue
had not yet taken up with Calvin or another great
name opposed to the Papacy, that might have led
his thoughts towards them. He was besides but indifferently
acquainted with the German language; in
circumstances, too, we may presume, that made it impossible
for him to remain in any place where he had
not remunerative occupation of some sort; and this,
with the whole world of the Reformation against him,
he saw he could not now obtain in quarters where he
had once hoped to find a welcome and a footing. He
had therefore no choice left but retreat; and Paris
was the place where accomplishments of the kind he
possessed were most likely to find a market.</p>

<p>With all his hardihood and self-confidence, Servetus
was not without so much prudence as assured him that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
a certain amount of caution and reticence was required
of everyone who would live at peace among his fellow
men. He doubtless imagined at one time, but had already
discovered his mistake, that among heretics, as
he had been accustomed to hear the Reformers designated,
he might freely expend himself in heresy. To
the very end of his life, he seems to have had some
difficulty in divining why he had not been welcomed
by them with open arms as a brother. But he was
well aware that Roman Catholic France had yet less
in common with Michael Serveto, alias Rev&eacute;s, author
of the Seven books and Two dialogues on Trinitarian
Error, than Protestant Switzerland and Germany.</p>

<p>Servetus felt that the writer of these works could
not safely show himself in Paris under either his proper
family or his maternal name, and so fell readily upon
one derived from the town of his nativity, Villanueva.
Servetus seems indeed at no time to have been very
particular as to his name and designation. On his trial
at Vienne he is of Tudela in Navarre, on that at Geneva,
of Villanova in Aragon; and Tollin finds him inscribed
in the academic register of Paris (1536) and in that of
Montpellier, which he must have visited some time
in 1540, as neither of Tudela nor Villanova, but of
Saragossa! During all the years he lived in France,
he was never known save as Monsieur Michel Villeneuve,
or, when he wrote in Latin, as Michael Villanovanus.
Under the name of Villeneuve he now
announced himself, entered as student of mathematics
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
and physics at one of the colleges, and at a later period
took his degrees of <small>M.A.</small> and <small>M.D.</small> in the University of
Paris. Under the same name he subsequently wrote
and edited various works at Lyons; and it was as M.
Villeneuve that he finally became known in the town
of Vienne in Dauphiny, where he lived for twelve
years engaged in the practice of medicine, and on
terms of intimacy with the Archbishop and all the
notabilities of the place, both lay and clerical.</p>

<p>As a man of scholarly acquirements Servetus in the
first instance probably found employment, and the
means of living with some of the typographers of
Paris, as reader and corrector of the press, a line of life
which he certainly followed for the next three or four
years, in the course of which we find notices of him first
at Orleans, then at Avignon, and finally at Lyons, one
of the chief centres of the printing and publishing
business that had been called into such vigorous life
by the revival of learning, the discovery of the art of
printing with moveable types, and finally and very
essentially by the Reformation.</p>

<p>It was during his first residence of about two years
at Paris, 1532-1534, that he made the acquaintance of
the man who became in the end his most implacable
enemy, and the immediate cause of his untimely and
cruel death. This was no other than the celebrated
John Calvin, then a young man and about the same
age as himself. Partially emancipated from the fetters
of the faith in which he had been born and bred,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
but not less firmly bound in others of his own fashioning,
Calvin had already attracted the notice of his
friends and the public by his natural abilities and his
scholarly acquirements, and been pointed out as likely
to influence the progress of the Reformation in his
native France. Hearing of Calvin’s presence in Paris,
Servetus as Villeneuve must have sought him out, and,
still full of the familiar theological subject, have made
an attempt upon him as he had already done upon
Œcolampadius and the others, for countenance and
approval in the discovery he had made of what he
believed to be the true saving Christian faith. But
with no better success we must conclude; for though
the two young men met oftener than once in private,
it was without coming to any agreement. They had,
therefore, actually resolved on a public discussion, with
a view to the voidance of their theological differences.</p>

<p>This, however, never came to pass. Such an exhibition,
indeed, could not have taken place at the time
without danger to both. Calvin, in his young zeal, and
for what he held to be the honour of God, would have
faced the danger, but the individual known to his
Parisian friends and Calvin as Michel Villeneuve must
have seen on afterthought that he could make no
public appearance as defender of the <i>outr&eacute;</i> opinions he
entertained, without betraying the Michael Serveto
of the De Trinitatis Erroribus and Dialogues who lay
hidden behind the adopted name; and this he knew
would be not only to disconcert all his present plans,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
but assuredly to compromise his life. Calvin, we must
presume, had not at this time heard of Servetus’s books;
very certainly he had not read them; for one so acute
and well-informed on theological matters as he, would
not have been more than a few minutes face to face
with their author without detecting him. But we find
no hint in Calvin’s writings that he then surmised who
Villeneuve, his Parisian acquaintance, really was, and
conclude that he lived for a dozen years or more without
suspecting that the individual he discovered as
Michael Serveto of the Book on Trinitarian Error in
his correspondent of Vienne, of the year 1546, was the
same Villeneuve he had known in Paris in 1534.</p>

<p>Calvin then would have faced the danger of the
public discussion, though persecution was hot at the
time against heresy, and he was not unsuspected on
this score. The danger to him, however, would have
been slight in comparison with that which Servetus must
have incurred. Calvin would not have stood forth on
this occasion as the defender of any heresy, but of the
very fundamentals of the Christian faith as embodied
in its Creeds; to some of the most essential propositions
in which Servetus, on the contrary, must have
shown himself diametrically opposed. Servetus therefore,
in this instance at least, saw perforce that discretion
was the better part of valour, and wisely stayed
away. He was in truth far too deeply compromised
to venture on an appearance; for if discovered to be
Michael Serveto, nothing could have saved him from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
the heretic’s death. He had nothing for it therefore
but to forfeit his engagement and lay himself open
to Calvin’s reproachful ‘<i>vous avez fuy la luite</i>’&mdash;you
fled the encounter&mdash;of a later and to him more momentous
epoch in their common lives.

<h2 id="BOOK_I_CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="center">LYONS. ENGAGEMENT AS READER FOR THE PRESS WITH
THE TRECHSELS. EDITS THE GEOGRAPHY OF PTOLEMY.</p>

<p>Theology, however, after which we see Servetus
still hankering&mdash;<i>h&aelig;ret lateri letalis arundo!</i>&mdash;and
even the study of the mathematics on which he was
now engaged, had to be abandoned for present means
of subsistence; and as Lyons seemed even a better
field for the scholar than Paris, to Lyons, after a short
stay at Avignon and Orleans, he betook himself.
There he appears immediately to have found employment
as reader and corrector of the press in the
house of the distinguished typographers, the Brothers
Trechsel; and if the Age have its character from the
aggregate of its science and culture, and the Individual
his bent from his more immediate surroundings, we
cannot but think of Servetus’s connection with these
light-spreaders as another among the highly influential
events in his life.</p>

<p>Books in the early days of printing were much
more generally written in Latin than in the vernacular,
and ever more and more with references to Greek,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
lately brought greatly into vogue by Erasmus and the
Reformers. The reader for press in the best establishments
was therefore, and of necessity, a scholar and
man of letters; and the opportunities for improvement
now put in the way of one like Servetus, even whilst
pursuing the mechanical part of his duties, have only
to be hinted at to be appreciated. The reading room
of the distinguished typographers of those days was,
indeed in some sort, a continuation of school and college
to the competent corrector of the press.</p>

<p>Servetus’s liberal elementary education, therefore,
stood him in good stead at this time; for the Trechsels
ere long, instead of holding him to the subordinate
though still important duties of reader and corrector,
engaged him further as editor of various costly works
that issued from their press. Among the number of
these a handsome edition of the Geography of Ptolemy<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a>
deserves particular mention, both as evincing the good
repute in which he stood when we find him entrusted
with such a work, and also as showing the extent of
his reading and general knowledge&mdash;strangely enough,
also, as influencing in some remote degree the fate that
finally befel him.</p>

<p>Earlier editions of the Ptolemy were faulty in
several ways, and disfigured in different degrees by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
errors due, in part at least, to indifferent editing. These,
where literal, Villanovanus corrected in the new issue;
and where the sense was obscure through faulty wording,
he brought light by the better readings he supplied,
having formed his text, as he says, by collating
all the editions he could lay his hands on, and where
these gave him no aid, by suggestions of his own.</p>

<p>In his address to the reader, our editor, whom we
shall often speak of under his adopted name of Villanovanus,
gives a short account of his author, Claudius
Ptolem&aelig;us, his birth-place, the Roman emperors under
whom he flourished, ‘his knowledge of philosophy and
the mathematics, and the more than Herculean glory
he achieved by his successful but peaceful invasion of
so many lands. Nor indeed was this all, for he may
be said to have bound earth to heaven by assimilating
the measurements of the one to those of the other; and,
coming after Strabo, Pliny, and Pomponius Mela, he
as far surpassed them, as they excelled all the geographers
who had gone before them.’</p>

<p>But Villanovanus did much more than edit and amend
the text of Ptolemy. ‘We,’ he says, ‘have added
scholia to the text, whereby the book is made more
interesting and more complete. Using our familiarity
with the historical, poetical, and miscellaneous writings
of the Greeks and Romans, in so far as they bear on
our subject, we have given the names by which the
countries, mountains, rivers, and cities were known to
them; and, to aid the tyro, have further translated the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
ancient titles of places into those by which they are
now designated&mdash;into French for France, Italian for
Italy, German for Germany, &amp;c., all of which countries
we have seen, besides having a knowledge of their languages.’
Extending his vision beyond the mere physical
features of the lands he is passing under review, he
might have added that he also gives short, but graphic
accounts of their inhabitants, the prominent traits of
their character, their manners, customs, &amp;c., which are
extremely interesting. But Michael Villanovanus is
not one of those who hide themselves behind their
good works, and so is he now careful to inform his
readers of the pains he has taken in their behalf. By
them, he says, he hopes his vigils will be properly appreciated,
‘for day and night have I laboured assiduously
at my task&mdash;<i>dies noctesque jugiter laboravi</i>.’ He
concludes his preliminary address in these words: ‘No
one, I imagine, will under-estimate the labour, though
pleasant in itself, that is implied in the collation of our
text with that of other earlier editions, unless it be some
Zoilus of the contracted brow, who cannot without envy
look on the serious labours of others. But thou, candid
reader, whoever thou art, we trust wilt be well disposed,
kindly to receive and to approve our work.
Farewell!’</p>

<p>Villanovanus’s edition of the Ptolemy is certainly an
advance on that of Bilibald Pirckheimer, which formed
its groundwork; but it is not so free from literal errors
as the laudatory address of the editor might lead us to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
expect. And it would have been better had he said
that he had enlarged and improved the short and
meagre scholia of his editorial predecessor than spoken
as if he had supplied them wholly of himself. Villanovanus’s
improved comments, however, impress us very
favourably with a sense of the pains he must have bestowed
on the work, and arouse our respect for the
extent and variety of the reading he had undertaken to
obtain the information he brings to bear on the physical
aspects and natural productions of the several countries
described, as well as of the customs, manners, and
moral qualities of their inhabitants. Now it was that
the smattering of geographic and historic lore he
may have picked up as a student at Saragossa and
elsewhere stood him in good stead, enabling him, as it
did, to advance and profit by the ample stores of information
of the kind which the city of Lyons placed
within his reach. Living immediately after the age of
the great navigators&mdash;Columbus, Vasco de Gama, Magellan,
the Vespucii, and the rest&mdash;and in the very days
when the works of Peter Martyr of Anghiera, Simon
Gryn&aelig;us, Sebastian Munster, and others enabled the
educated to acquire something like a true knowledge of
the world they lived in, the new edition of Ptolemy by
Michael Villanovanus was a happy thought, and contributed,
we need not doubt, no less to his own development
than to the spread of useful and humanising
information. Engaged on the Ptolemy, the super-subtleties
of scholasticism and theology seem to have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
vanished before the light of the more positive kind of
knowledge that now broke around him.</p>

<p>When we turn to the writings of the able individuals
mentioned above, we have no difficulty in discovering
whence Servetus had most, perhaps all, of his geographical
and astronomical knowledge. The Opus Epistolarum
of Angleria, in particular, seems to have been
the mine from whence he made himself rich in mental
wealth of many kinds. We find him imitating, and
even improving upon, the lines which head Angleria’s
<i>De Rebus Oceanicis</i> and Gryn&aelig;us’s <i>Typi Cosmographici</i>,
as the reader may see by comparing the verse
below<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> with the one he will find further on, which is
prefixed to the 2nd edition of the Ptolemy.</p>

<p>Turning to the Scholia of Villanovanus, we find it
not a little interesting in these days to have a glimpse
of ourselves in our sires, and of our neighbours in theirs,
from the pen of a man of genius hard upon three centuries
and a half ago; and as Michael Servetus is really
only known to us through his works and the judicial
trials he underwent, we make no apology for referring
briefly to his additions to the bald and matter-of-fact
text of the original Ptolemy.</p>

<p>The map of the first country in the series of fifty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
by which the work is illustrated is that of Great Britain.
The people of <span class="smcap">Scotland</span>, Villanovanus informs
his reader, are hot-tempered, prone to revenge, and
fierce in their anger; but valiant in war and patient
beyond belief of cold, hunger, and fatigue. They are
handsome in person, and their clothing and language
are the same as those of the Irish, their tunics being
dyed yellow, their legs bare, and their feet protected
by sandals of undressed hide with the hair on. They
live mainly on fish and flesh; they have numerous
flocks, mostly of sheep, for the country is free from
wolves; and they have milk and cheese in abundance.
Their arms are bows and arrows and broad swords&mdash;<i>lati
gladii</i>. Instead of wood, they have coal for fuel.
Unlike the people of the last few generations, he says
the Scotch are not a particularly religious people. He
‘who never feared the face of man,’ as the Earl of
Morton said of Knox, when looking down on his dead
body, had not yet made himself felt in the land of his
birth; and the School-house had not yet risen as a
necessary complement to the Kirk and the Manse, to
make the people of Scotland what they have become since
his day&mdash;among the very foremost of the sons of men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">England</span>, Villanovanus observes, is wonderfully
well peopled, and the inhabitants are long-lived. Tall
in stature, they are fair in complexion, and have blue
eyes. They are brave in war, and admirable bowmen.
He has the familiar tale of the English children seen as
captives at Rome by the blessed Gregory, who said
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
they were called Angli, indeed; but in form and feature
showed like Angeli. He must, as it seems, have
given some little attention to the English language, if
he did not study it more particularly. He says it is so
difficult to learn and to pronounce, because the people
who speak it are a compound of so many different
races.</p>

<p>Of <span class="smcap">Ireland</span> and the Irish our editor does not speak
so favourably. The country, he observes, is generally
marshy, so that, unless the summers are dry, the cattle
are apt to get lost in the bogs. It is free from noxious
creatures of every kind, there being no reptiles, such
as snakes, toads, and frogs, and no insects, such as
spiders and bees&mdash;a state of things which, if it ever
obtained, certainly does so no longer. The climate is
very temperate, and the soil of great fertility; but the
people are rude, inhospitable, barbarous, and cruel,
more given to hunting and idle play than to industry.
Only three days’ sail from Spain, the Irish, he says,
have many customs in common with the Spaniards.</p>

<p>Of <span class="smcap">Spain</span>, the account given is particularly full, but
by no means complimentary, and its people are contrasted&mdash;not
to their advantage&mdash;with their neighbours
the French. The extreme dryness of the climate is
noticed, which tends to make the country less fertile
than France. Irrigation, however, being practised on
an extensive scale in many parts, tends to make up for
the infrequency of rain, the conduits being often carried
to great distances from the rivers. His description of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
the people is far from laudatory. ‘The Spaniard,’ he
says, ‘is of a restless disposition, apt enough of understanding,
but learning imperfectly or amiss, so that you
shall find a learned Spaniard almost anywhere sooner
than in Spain. Half-informed, he thinks himself brimful
of information, and always pretends to more knowledge
than he has in fact. He is much given to vast
projects, never realised; and in conversation he delights
in subtleties and sophistry. Teachers commonly
prefer to speak Spanish rather than Latin in the
schools and colleges of the country; but the people in
general have little taste for letters, and produce few
books themselves, mostly procuring those they want
from France.’ The Spanish language, indeed, he
speaks of as defective in many respects, and does not
fail to remark on the number of Moorish words incorporated
with it. The people, he says, ‘have many
barbarous notions and usages,’ derived by implication
from their old Moorish conquerors and fellow-denizens.
‘The women have a custom that would be held barbarous
in France, of piercing their ears and hanging gold
rings in them, often set with precious stones. They
besmirch their faces, too, with minium and ceruse&mdash;red
and white lead&mdash;and walk about on clogs a foot or
a foot and a half high, so that they seem to walk above
rather than on the earth. The people are extremely
temperate, and the women never drink wine. Spaniards,
he concludes, are notably the most superstitious
people in the world in their religious notions; but they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
are brave in the field, of signal endurance under privation
and difficulty, and by their voyages of discovery
have spread their name over the face of the globe.’</p>

<p>Of <span class="smcap">France</span>, M. Villeneuve has less to say than of
Spain; but what he tells us of the royal touch for the
cure of scrofula is still interesting in the annals of
superstition. ‘I have myself seen the king touching
many labouring under this disease, but I did not see
that they were cured.’</p>

<p>Of <span class="smcap">Germany</span>, and he uses the title in a very comprehensive
sense&mdash;he speaks at considerable length.
Smarting under the rebuff he had received at the
hands of the Swiss and German Reformers, he is nowise
disposed to find the Teutons and their congeners
or neighbours however designated, an interesting
people, or their territories as in any way attractive.
Referring to Tacitus’s account of Germany proper, as
overgrown by vast forests, and defaced by frightful
swamps, its climate he says is at once as insufferably
hot in summer as it is bitterly cold in winter.
‘Hungary,’ he observes, ‘is commonly said to produce
oxen, Bavaria swine, Franconia onions, turnips and
liquorice, Swabia harlots, Bohemia heretics, Switzerland
butchers, Westphalia cheats, and the whole
country gluttons and drunkards. The Germans, however,
are a religious people; not easily turned from
opinions they have once espoused and not readily persuaded
to concord in matters of schism, everyone
valiantly and obstinately defending the heresy he has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
himself adopted;’ words in which we may presume
Villanovanus sought to give ease to the pent-up displeasure
he felt against his repudiators, the Reformers
of Basle and Strasburg.</p>

<p>Of <span class="smcap">Italy</span> and its people he has little to say; and
that not good. The natives readily enough pretend
to forgive injuries, but, occasion offering, none revenge
themselves so savagely. They make use in their
everyday talk of the most horrid oaths and imprecations.
Holding all the rest of the world in contempt
and calling them barbarians, they themselves have
nevertheless been alternately the prey of France, of
Spain, and of Germany.</p>

<p>In his survey of <span class="smcap">Babylonia</span>, he refers to a certain
abominable custom observed by young marriageable
women, which is particularly mentioned by Herodotus
and also by the writers of the Bible, when read by
unsealed eyes, as obtaining among the Jews, and of
the money, so objectionably earned in our estimation,
being devoted to the service of the Temple.</p>

<p>But the most interesting to us perhaps of all the
commentaries attached to the Ptolemy, inasmuch as it
influenced the fate of Servetus on his trial at Geneva,
is the one appended to the map of <span class="smcap">Palestine</span> or the
Holy Land. Demurring to much that is said in praise
of <span class="smcap">Jud&aelig;a</span> in the Bible and by Josephus, as a country
specially blessed in various ways, as being well-watered,
fertile, &amp;c., the commentator says, that in so far as
climate is concerned, it is a temperate land, obnoxious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
to the extremes neither of heat nor of cold; a condition
of things that may have led the Israelites or Hebrews
to imagine that it must be the land that was promised
to their forefathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; a land
metaphorically said to be flowing with milk and honey.
‘The Israelites,’ it is said in continuation, ‘lived at
length under laws received from Moses, although they
had gone on piously and prosperously enough through
countless ages, before his day, without any written law,
having had regard to the oracles of divine or natural
truth alone, gifted as they were with aptitude and
greatness of mind. Moses, however, that distinguished
theologian, thinking that no state could exist without
a written code of law and equity, gave them one
reduced to ten principal heads, engraved on two tables
of stone; with the addition of a great number of minor
commandments for the regulation of their lives and
dealings with one another. But any more particular
notice of these, they being so numerous&mdash;great birds
not sitting in little nests&mdash;must here be passed by.
Know, however, most worthy reader, that it is mere
boasting and untruth when so much of excellence
is ascribed to this land; the experience of merchants
and others, travellers who have visited it, proving it to
be inhospitable, barren, and altogether without amenity.
Wherefore you may say that the land was <i>promised</i>,
indeed, but is of <i>little promise</i> when spoken of in
everyday terms.’</p>

<p>The Ptolemy of Villanovanus was well received,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
and though costly, a second edition was by and by
required. We find it much commended in subsequent
reprints by their publishers; and no wonder, for the
Ptolemy is really a sumptuous book, upon which a
large sum of money must have been spent, the
typography being excellent and the text profusely
ornamented with woodcuts on the sides of the pages
as well as at the heads and tails of the chapters.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span></p>

<h2 id="BOOK_I_CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.<br />

<span class="medium">LYONS. DOCTOR SYMPHORIEN CHAMPIER.</span></h2>

<p>It was whilst engaged in the revision of such works
as the Ptolemy and others on the natural sciences,
anatomy, medicine, pharmacy, &amp;c., in the service of
the Trechsels, that Servetus may be said to have
entered on the second, if it were not rather the third,
stage of his mental development. The typographer’s
reading-room had in truth proved the means of his
continued education; each new volume he read and
corrected being found a teacher not less influential
than the Professor from his chair. The Convent
school, Toulouse, and his engagement with Quintana
had borne fruit of the kind we discover in the book on
Trinitarian error; it was the reading-room of the
printers of Lyons that brought him back from the empyrean
of metaphysics to the earth, and put him in the
way of becoming the geographer, astrologian, biblical
critic, physiologist and physician we are made familiar
with in his subsequent life and writings.</p>

<p>Among the learned works that flowed in a sort of
ceaseless stream from the presses of the Trechsels
during Servetus’s tenure of his office as reader with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
them, were several from the fertile pen of Doctor
Symphorien Champier, or, when he latinised his name,
Campeggius, a man of large and liberal culture, of a
truly noble nature, an admirer of learning and a patron
of the learned; possessed moreover of that restless
vanity which made him feel it as much a matter of
necessity to live in the eye of the world as to breathe;
the effect of which was that he exerted the widest and
most beneficent influence among his fellow men. Indefatigable
in his proper calling, there was yet nothing
which interested the citizens of Lyons that did not
interest him. Fearless in bringing help on the battle-field,
to which he accompanied his chief the Duke of
Lorraine, he was no less ready to brave pestilence in
the city, and was as often to be seen in the hovels
of the poor as in the palaces of the great and wealthy&mdash;<i>inopibus
et infortunatis &aelig;que indiscriminatimque
succurris opitularisve</i>, says his biographer&mdash;a true
physician, a great and good man.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>

<p>Among Champier’s numerous works published
about this time, we note the <span class="smcap">Pentapharmacum Gallicum</span>
(Lyons, 1534), which Servetus we believe read and
corrected for press, the gist of the work being to show
that each country produces the medicines best adapted
to cure the diseases of its inhabitants, and that to them
exotics are for the most part not only useless, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
injurious; an assumption in which he differs notably
from present experience and the great writer, his countryman,
who came after him, and said that ‘God had
inflicted fever on Europe, but put its remedy in
America.’ Correcting the proofs of Champier’s five-fold
French Pharmacopœia, Servetus must have introduced
himself to, or become acquainted with, the
author; and if we may credit Pastor Henry Tollin,
who will have everyone as truly interested in Servetus
as himself, Champier was so much taken by the accomplishments
of the poor scholar as even to make a home
for him in Lyons. Be this as it may, certain it seems
that contact with Champier was that which led Servetus
to study medicine, of which he had not thought until now,
for it was a science much looked down on by Spaniards
in general, its practice being mostly in the hands of Jews
and Moors, whom to contemn, where not to oppress,
was a religion with all who boasted of their blue blood.</p>

<p>Another of Champier’s books printed by the
Trechsels, which we need not doubt Servetus had also
read and put to use, was the ‘Hortus Gallicus’ (Lyons
1533). But more influential on him still, though printed
in another establishment (that of Seb. Gryphius) during
the time he lived in Lyons, was the great Lyonnese Doctor’s
<span class="smcap">Cribratio Medicamentorum</span>, with the <span class="smcap">Medulla
Philosophle</span>&mdash;the Marrow of Philosophy&mdash;appended.
In his chapter on the Vital, Animal, and Natural
Spirits (p. 137), Champier speaks of ‘spirit as a
subtle, aerial, translucid substance produced of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
finest part of the blood, and carried by it from the
heart, as principal vital organ, to all parts of the body.
Spoken of as three,’ he continues, ‘there are in truth
but two kinds of spirit, the vital and the animal.’ The
sameness of this to what we shall find in the ‘Christianismi
Restitutio’ will be obvious to all. It strikes us
in fact that Villanovanus’s first medical production&mdash;the
Treatise on Syrups&mdash;was wholly inspired by this
Marrow of Philosophy of Champier, in which we discover
much upon digestion and concoction, the maturation
and evacuation of the humours, etc., precisely as
in the treatise ‘De Syrupis.’</p>

<p>Nor did Champier’s influence on our scholar end
here. One of the Doctor’s treatises is entitled, ‘Prognosticon
perpetuum Astrologorum, Medicorum et
Prophetarum&mdash;The guide of the Astrologer, Physician
and Prophet in their prognostications or forecasts.’
Like so many in his age, Champier was a devoted
astrologer; and it was he we may conclude who made
Servetus one too. Champier having been attacked on
the score of his astrology by Leonhard Fuchs, Professor
of Medicine in Heidelberg,<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> Michael Villanovanus,
as grateful pupil, took up the pen in defence of his
master, and replied by a pamphlet entitled, ‘Defence of
Symphorien Champier, addressed to Leonhard Fuchs,<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a>
and an Apologetic Dissertation on Astrology.’<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> Villanovanus,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
it seems, would not neglect what he must have
thought a favourable opportunity of showing himself to
the world in company with so distinguished an individual
as the great Physician of Lyons, to whom he owns
himself much indebted&mdash;<i>cui multum debeo</i>, and ventilating
a subject that interested him, like so many of
his age, only in a less degree than theology itself.

<p class="hang">RETURN TO PARIS. STUDIES THERE. JO. WINTER OF
ANDERNACH; ANDREA VESALIUS. DEGREES OF M.A.
AND M.D. LECTURES ON GEOGRAPHY AND ASTROLOGY.</p>

<p>Villeneuve, we must presume, had reached Lyons
poor enough in pocket if rich in lore; but so diligently
had he laboured and so liberally had he been paid by
the princely publishers of the day, that within two
years he found himself in funds sufficient to authorise
a return to Paris with a view to the study of Medicine,
which he had now resolved to make his profession for
life. The rebuff he had had from Œcolampadius,
Bucer, and the rest, had probably sickened him for a
while with theology and scholasticism, from which, however,
we may presume he had only been diverted by
his failure to make an immediate impression on the
Reformers and the necessity of providing for his daily
wants. But ‘the fresh fields and pastures new’ brought
into sight by the study of Ptolemy, and the healthy
influence of Champier, the physician and naturalist,
gave another turn to his mind, and with the money he
had earned in his purse, but still comporting himself as
the poor scholar, he entered first the College of Calvi,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
and then that of the Lombards. To these as a subject
of the Holy Roman Empire he probably had ready
access, and in their quiet shades devoted himself to the
new course of study he had determined to pursue.</p>

<p>His larger experience and intercourse with Champier
must have shown Servetus that medicine was a more
assured means of earning a subsistence than theology,
and opened up a far wider field to his ambition than continued
service with the typographers. Without utterly
neglecting older studies, therefore, he now gave his
chief attention to the great and useful art and science
of medicine; and we shall find as we proceed that the
lessons of such teachers as Joannes Guinterus (Jo. Winter
of Andernach), Jacobus Sylvius (J. du Bois), Joannes
Fernelius, and others of name and fame in their day,
found congenial soil in the receptive mind of the student.</p>

<p>Servetus, indeed, would seem immediately to
have made his presence felt in the medical school of
Paris; he was at once more than a listener to the
prelections of its professors. Associated with no less
distinguished an individual than Andrea Vesalius, he
was one of Winter of Andernach’s two prosectors, and
prepared the subject for each day’s demonstration.</p>

<p>And let not the conjunction of talent that meets
us here be overlooked. Vesalius, repudiating the
authority of Galen, became the restorer&mdash;the <i>Creator</i> of
Modern Anatomy. Servetus, breaking with scholasticism
in theology, and freeing himself from the shackles
of Greeks and Arabians in practical medicine, inaugurated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
Rational Physiology when he proclaimed the
course of the blood from the right to the left side of
the heart through the lungs. Working together as
friends and fellow students for the Professor of Anatomy,
Vesalius and Servetus, through diversity of mental
constitution, yet saw things diversely. Vesalius, the
observer, abiding by the <i>concrete</i>, described with rare
felicity and truthfulness what he witnessed; Servetus,
gifted with genius, aspiring to the <i>ideal</i> and inferring
consequences, deduced the pulmonary circulation from
the structure of the heart and lungs!</p>

<p>Nor were the two men associates only in their studies;
they were fellows also in the untoward fate that befel
them both in after life; for both may be said to have
fallen victims to their zeal. Somewhat precipitate, we
may presume, in his eagerness for information, the
heart of a young nobleman who had died under his
care and whose body Vesalius was inspecting, was
either seen to palpitate, or was thought to have palpitated,
when touched by the knife of the anatomist.
Accused forthwith of murder, it was only by the interference
of Philip II. of Spain, whose physician Vesalius
was, that a formal trial for manslaughter was commuted
for a pilgrimage to Jerusalem with confession and
absolution at the shrine of the Holy Sepulchre. The
penance was undergone, but the pilgrim, homeward
bound, suffered shipwreck on the island of Crete, and
perished miserably there. Servetus again, as we shall
see, in his eagerness to proclaim what he believed to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
the truth, and given no chance for his life, had to abide
the still more cruel death of the faggot and stake.</p>

<p>Joannes Guinterus, it is interesting to know, bears
honourable testimony to the merits of his two assistants.
In the preface to his ‘Anatomical Institutions’ he
informs us that ‘he had been most effectually aided in
the preparation of the work, first by Andrea Vesalius, a
young man, by Hercules! singularly proficient in
anatomy; and after him by Michael Villanovanus,
distinguished by his literary acquirements of every
kind, and scarcely second to any in his knowledge of
Galenical doctrine. Under the supervision and with
the aid of these two,’ he continues, ‘I have myself
examined in the Subject and have shown to the
students the whole of the muscles, veins, arteries, and
nerves, both of the extremities and internal parts of the
body.’<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> From this we learn whence Servetus had the
anatomical knowledge that enabled him as inductive
reasoner&mdash;true forerunner here of our own immortal
Harvey&mdash;to proclaim the pulmonary circulation.</p>

<p>The practice of dissecting the human subject had
therefore, by this time, extended to France&mdash;the bodies
of one or more malefactors being now publicly anatomised
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
in the course of each winter session.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> Had we
no other evidence of the genius with which Michael
Servetus was endowed, beyond the use he made of
what he saw in these anatomical demonstrations, we
should still feel entitled to speak of him as the most
far-sighted physiologist of his age; for he alone of all
his contemporaries, though fettered by the prevalent
metaphysical theories of life, the soul and the spirits,
from which we ourselves have not yet escaped, not
only divined, but positively proclaimed the passage of
the blood, by way of the lungs, from the right to the
left side of the heart, and thence&mdash;but stopping short of
the whole truth, first proclaimed by Harvey&mdash;from the
left ventricle of the heart to the body at large. But the
book in which his important Induction is contained,
though printed in his lifetime, <i>was never published</i>.
Seen by none but a few theologians, who took no note
of its physiological contents, it remained unknown to
the world for nearly a century and a half, after its author
had fallen a victim to the hate of Calvin and the intolerance
of his age.</p>

<p>With the stimulus of necessity upon him, for he was
poor, and the excitement of vanity, with which he was
largely endowed, as he could not live on the learning
he imbibed from his teachers, Servetus by-and-by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
appeared before the world as a teacher in his turn.
Having by diligence and superior natural capacity, in a
singularly short space of time, achieved the degrees of
M.A. and M.D., which were required before he could
present himself either as Professor or Physician within
the domain of the University of Paris, Servetus now
came forward as a Lecturer on the Geography of Ptolemy
and the science of Astrology&mdash;a term which then
included the true doctrine of the heavenly bodies as
well as the false doctrine of their presumed influence
on the life of man and the current of events in the
world. In this bold step we have another glimpse of
the self-reliant, and it may be, somewhat presumptuous,
character of the man; for even as the emancipated
novice of the monk’s school and Saragossan professors,
when little more than of age, showed himself as
Theologian in the ‘De Erroribus Trinitatis,’ so did the
newly becapped Magister Artium now come forward
as Lecturer on Geography and Astrology, and the
scarce fledged doctor in physic, as a teacher of his
fellows and the world at large, in the art and mystery of
treating Disease.</p>

<p>The course of Lectures on Geography and Astrology
was a happy thought, and proved highly successful.
It was delivered to a large and distinguished audience,
and besides supplying the professor with funds for
all his wants, became a means of introducing him to
friends, influential for good on his future life. Amongst
the number of his auditors there was a young ecclesiastic,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
a scholar and man of talent, Pierre Paumier,
who after employment in various offices of trust by his
king, Francis the First, was transferred to a position
of no less dignity and emolument than that of Archbishop
of Vienne in Dauphiny.</p>

<p>Under the auspices of the Archbishop, and as
we believe on his invitation, it was that Servetus found
a final resting place by his side. Fresh from editing
Ptolemy, with the old stores of classic lore he had at
command, and of anecdote and general information he
had amassed in reading up for his editorial duties,
aided by the natural fluency with which we venture to
credit him, it is easy to imagine how interesting these
Lectures must have been in days when the world was
eager for information on the discoveries of the great
voyagers and travellers of the age, and when books
were still both scarce and costly, and little read by the
many.</p>

<p>But Servetus was a Physician as well as Geographer
and Astrologer, and not the man to hide any
light he had under a bushel. He must appear in connection
with his profession, as well as in the accessory
field of general knowledge, by writing a book upon
some properly medical subject, a business which he
set about forthwith under the immediate inspiration of
all he had learned from Dr. Champier of Lyons, as
well as his professors of Paris.

<p class="center">THE TREATISE ON SYRUPS AND THEIR USE
IN MEDICINE.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></p>

<p>The medical world in the early part of the sixteenth
century was divided into two great hostile camps,
respectively designated Galenists, or followers of the
Greeks, and Averrhoists, or disciples of the Arabians;
the former swearing by Hippocrates and Galen, the
latter by Averrhoes and Avicenna. Servetus’s initiator
into matters medical, Champier, was a fervent admirer
of the Greeks; and his pupil, led by his classical
training as well as his master’s example, naturally
attached himself to the same school. Here, nevertheless,
as ever, he showed the independence of his nature
by having open eyes for any truth the Arabian writers
might present; so that we find nothing of servility or
one-sidedness in what he has to say.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span></p>

<p>The treatise in which Villanovanus came before the
public in his new capacity of physician was on the
practical use of the class of medicines known in those
days by the title of Syrups&mdash;sweetened decoctions or
infusions of different kinds, still in vogue among the
French under the name of Tisanes. These syrups
appear to have been one of the bones of contention
between the two parties, though neither was perfectly
agreed in itself as to the indications for their use or of
the principles on which they were to be prescribed.
This question does not interest us here, and so we leave
it; but we turn to the work of Michael Villanovanus
for intimations in its style of the intellectual and moral
nature of its author.</p>

<p>In his address to the reader he says, ‘I should not
have proposed, most learned reader, to take on my
weak shoulders this weighty and so much disputed
province of the healing art, had I not felt me forced,
against my will as it were, to lend my aid in furthering
medical studies by a fair defence of Galenical doctrine,
and more especially still by my love of truth.... I
think it will be found that I have conciliated Galen so
far with my own views as to dispel any doubts I may
have had of a favourable award, if I have only an
equitable judge in my reader. Of this, at all events, I
feel well assured that no studious person who carefully
weighs what is here set forth will repent him of his
reading.’ This is not amiss from a Doctor of a year’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
standing! But it is in his Preface to the work that
Michael Villanovanus, as we apprehend him, comes still
more particularly before us. Aware, as he says, of the
fate that so often befals the meddler in a quarrel not
his own, and displaying a commendable amount of
caution, not without a spice of mock modesty, our
author is here considerate enough to tell us that ‘he
does not intend to offer himself as censor in the controversy,
between the Galenists and Averrhoists, and
by finding something to object to in the conclusions of
each, to have them both fall foul of him as an enemy;’
after which he proceeds, characteristically still, to say,
‘but that I may not withhold from others that which I
possess myself and gratefully acknowledge, which may
be of use to my fellow men, I throw aside fear and proclaim
what I believe to be the truth.’</p>

<p>The ‘Syruporum Universa Ratio,’ or general
Rationale of Syrups, is in truth a very learned little
book, extremely well written; much of it, as becomes
the young practitioner, having reference to the writings
of predecessors of the highest authority in medical
science. Hippocrates and Galen, above all others, are
freely quoted, and their views discussed, for Servetus
was ‘nothing if not critical,’ and a variorum reading or
two to show his scholarship is proposed. But he also
refers to Avicenna, not thinking it amiss to learn
of the enemy, and to Paul of Aegina, Monardus and
others, by which he proclaims the extent of his reading,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
and his readiness to imbibe knowledge at every
source.</p>

<p>I looked with interest for some physiological hint
or statement in this book, on Syrups or Diet drinks,
that might have heralded the brilliant exposition contained
in the latest product of his genius&mdash;the Christianismi
Restitutio or Restoration of Christianity&mdash;concerning
the way in which the blood from the right
reaches the left ventricle of the heart through the lungs,
but in vain. We must presume nevertheless that he
was already possessed of the anatomical facts on which
his later induction is founded. The only physiological
reference I discovered in the book on Syrups was to
the Mesentery as giving origin to the veins&mdash;a step in
advance of his predecessors, with whom the liver was
the source as it was also the laboratory of the blood,
as the veins were the channels for its distribution to
the body.</p>

<p>It is not uninteresting, however, to observe the same
tendency towards unity or oneness here, in the domain
of positive knowledge, which we discover pervading
Servetus’s other works that lose themselves in the realm
of metaphysical abstraction. He will not acknowledge
two or any greater number of concoctions or digestions,
whether in health or disease, such as were generally
admitted in his day. The processes that take place
in disease he declares to be of the same nature, though
they are perverted, as those that occur in the healthy
body. Diseases are therefore nothing more than perversions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
of natural functions, not new entities introduced
into the body; a conclusion which, on physiological
grounds, he sums up in these words: ‘The rationale
in the maturation of disease and in the digestion of the
food is one and the same.’<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a>

<h2 id="BOOK_I_CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p class="center">THE MEDICAL FACULTY OF PARIS SUE VILLANOVANUS
FOR LECTURING ON JUDICIAL ASTROLOGY.</p>

<p>Servetus’s fate on starting in life was opposition; and
how should it have been otherwise?&mdash;he found himself
through superior endowment and higher culture
antagonistic to almost all he saw around him in the
world. We have already had him met as a trespasser
on their domain by the Reformers of Basle and Strasburg,
and we have now to find him looked on as an intruder
by the Medical Faculty of Paris. The lecturer
on Geography and Astrology had attracted a large
amount of public attention, and the author of the book
on Syrups began to get into vogue as a practitioner of
medicine. The book had in fact been as well received
as the lectures; it was extensively read, much commended
at the time, and reprinted oftener than once
in after years. No wonder, therefore, that Michel
Villeneuve M.D. had now as many eyes upon him in
Paris as Michael Servetus had had in other days in
Switzerland. Before he could well look about him,
the whole faculty of Physicians and the heads of the
University of Paris were in array against him.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span></p>

<p>It seems that he had gone out of his way in his
lectures to say something disrespectful of the doctors,
his contemporaries, accusing them of ignorance of many
things necessary to the successful practice of their
profession, particularly of Astronomy, or more properly
Astrology, a science in which Villeneuve plumed himself
as being a master. The doctors naturally enough
complained of such impropriety, and had him cited
before their council. There he was told that something
more of respectful bearing was due from him to men
who had been his masters; and above all that he was
transgressing the boundaries of true science and common
sense in making so much of Astrology. The Dean
of the Faculty is even said to have had him several
times privately before him, and warned him of the
difficulties he would inevitably fall into, if he continued
casting nativities and prescribing for the ailments of
his patients from the aspects of the stars; for this, it
appears, was the principal element in his medical practice.
Servetus, unhappily for himself, was not one of
those who could take even friendly advice in good part.
As credulous as he was sceptical, and believing implicitly
in himself and in stellar influences, he not only
made no submission, but said that his ill-wishers should
rue their opposition.</p>

<p>The doctors on their part not only gave no heed to
his threats, but publicly denounced him from their
chairs as an impostor and wind-bag; with the consequence
of arousing him to self-defence, and with his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
ready pen setting him to work upon a pamphlet, in
which he did not fail to lay bare some of the sore
places in the persons of his adversaries, characterising
them as mannerless and unlettered, and even holding
them up in their ignorance as very pests of society.
Once in the hands of the printer, Villeneuve’s purpose
to expose his detractors through the dreaded press
became known; and such alarm does his meditated
attack appear to have excited that the Faculty of Physicians,
calling the Senate of the University to their
side, petitioned the Parliament of Paris to forbid the
publication of the pamphlet, as well as to interdict its
author from continuing to lecture on Astrology, which
they now characterised as Divination.</p>

<p>The Parliament, with becoming judicial impartiality,
would take no step in the matter until they had heard
Villeneuve in his defence and had something tangible,
such as the pamphlet which it was sought to suppress,
before them. Nothing more was done, consequently,
than the issuing of a summons to Villeneuve to appear
at the bar of the house on a certain day and give an
account of himself. This gave him all he required:
time to have his pamphlet printed. Keeping the
compositors at work, with a promise of higher pay if
they used despatch, it was not only ready before the
day of citation came round, but had been distributed
gratis in numbers to the public as well as to the
members of the medical profession. They reckoned
without their host who thought that Michel Villeneuve
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
was to be cowed by opposition, however imposingly
headed.</p>

<p>The doctors were naturally excessively wroth with
this daring move on the part of the man they desired
to crush. He had not awaited the decision of the
Parliament; and neither now did they pause; for believing
they had a hold upon him on the score of
heresy, implied in the practice of judicial astrology or
divination, they had him summoned before the Inquisitor
of the king as an enemy to the Church, and contemner
of its statutes. There was no regularly established
Inquisition at this time in France; but papal
inquisitors, often Italians by birth, were commonly
enough found accredited by the Holy See, with the
sanction of the Sovereign, to the large towns of the
country. There they held courts before which cases
of imputed heresy were tried and adjudged&mdash;the decisions
come to, however, being always made subject to
revision by the civil tribunals of the realm. Nay,
there was a right of demurrage to the jurisdiction of
the inquisitor, at the option of the party incriminated,
were he minded to be tried by the ordinary civil, rather
than the extraordinary ecclesiastical, court.</p>

<p>We might have imagined that Michael Servetus,
with the experience he had had of ecclesiastical incapacity
to hear reason and ‘true judgment give,’ as he
interpreted it, would have paused before venturing to
appear before the inquisitor of the king; but so safe
must Michel Villeneuve have felt against a charge of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
heresy at this time, and so secure in his new designation,
that he did not hesitate to obey the summons;
although we learn that had he been so minded, he
might as a member of the Faculty of Physicians have
even disregarded it entirely. He appeared accordingly
at the proper moment; and so well did he play his part,
so thoroughly did he satisfy the inquisitor of the king
that he was a good Christian, that he left the court
with flying colours, absolved of all suspicion of heresy,
to the utter discomfiture of his accusers, who had now
nothing for it but patiently to wait the award of the
Parliament.</p>

<p>Before this tribunal, acting it would seem as a
court of justice, a suit was regularly instituted, with
the Rector of the University of Paris and the Dean
and Faculty of Physic of the same as pursuers, on the
one part, and Michael Villanovanus as defendant, on
the other. For the University and Faculty, it was
alleged that judicial astrology, otherwise to be styled
divination, is forbidden by various statutes, as well
canonical and divine as civil, the penalty for practising
the same being death by fire, and that the defendant,
a man of learning, and so incapacitated from pleading
ignorance of these statutes, had notoriously lectured
both in public and private on certain books of divination,
among others, on the works entitled ‘De Aleabiticis’
and ‘De Divificationibus,’ both of which are full
of divination.</p>

<p>It was alleged further, that he had been known to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
make forecasts for various persons in respect of their
fortunes from their nativities, on the assumption that
according to the day and the hour of a man’s birth,
and the aspect of the heavens at the time, would fortune
of a favourable or adverse kind befal him; all of
which by the Faculty of Theology is held highly reprehensible.
That for his lectures and lessons, moreover,
he takes money and attracts numerous auditors,
who, seduced by the pleasantness of the poison he
sells, have been debauched and led to forsake the true
philosophy of Pico de Mirandola, who declares divination
to be the most pestilent of frauds, degrading philosophy,
invalidating religion, strengthening superstition,
corrupting morals, and making men miserable slaves
instead of free men.</p>

<p>Not stopping short at such public and private
misdeeds, continue the pursuers, he has written and
had printed a certain apology or defence of divination,<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a>
with his name attached, which is of a highly objectionable
character in every respect; the Theological
Faculty declaring in addition that the concluding sentence
of this apology has an extremely suspicious appearance,
couched as it is in these words: ‘On the
following night Mars is eclipsed by the moon, near the
star called the King, in the constellation of Leo;
whence I predict that in the course of this year the
hearts of the Lions, i.e. the princes, will be greatly
moved; that with Mars in the ascendant war will prevail,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
and much havoc be done by fire and sword; that
the Church will suffer tribulation, several princes die,
and pestilence and other evils abound. To languish,
to mourn, to die&mdash;all of good or ill that comes to man
proceeds from heaven.’</p>

<p>The petition of the pursuers on the above showing
therefore is, that the defendant, Villanovanus, be interdicted
for the future from professing and practising
judicial astrology, whether in public or private; that
he be forbidden further to circulate his pamphlet
against the Faculty, and commanded to call in all unsold
copies; that for what has passed he own himself
to blame, and be enjoined for the future to bear himself
respectfully towards the Faculty of Physic, to which
he belongs.</p>

<p>In his address to the court on behalf of his client,
Villanovanus’s counsel opined that the Faculty of
Physic had descended somewhat from the dignity that
became so great a body in taking steps against one, a
stranger, who had been attracted to Paris by the
science that distinguished it, of which he had heard so
much. The cause of the hostility of the Faculty
against his client, he said, was owing to his having
insisted on the necessity of a knowledge of astronomy
to the Physician. This had been turned into a knowledge
of judicial astrology by his enemies; but there
were many of his hearers who were ready to testify
that he had never even mentioned judicial astrology.
As to the paragraph about the Lions, he had only
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
given it as illustrating the rules of astrological science,
and the knowledge he has of the possible influence of
the stars; but he would by no means insist that events
of the kind named must happen as matter of necessity.
In all this, however, he is ready to submit himself to
the judgment of the court, and on his words being
pronounced objectionable, he is willing to be set right.
With regard to what he says in his apology about
physicians being the plagues of society, he of course
only aims at the ignorant and unskilful among them;
the saying, indeed, is none of his, but Galen’s, who
speaks of the ignorant practitioners of medicine of his
day in precisely the same words.</p>

<p>The judgment of the court is nearly in the terms
of the counsel’s address for the prosecution. His
statements appear to have been taken as trustworthy
without further evidence adduced. Villanovanus is
ordered to call in his pamphlet and deposit the copies
with the proper officer of the court; to pay all honour
and respect to the Faculty of Physic in its collective
and individual capacity, saying and writing nothing
unbecoming of it, but conducting himself at all times
peacefully and reverently towards its members; the
doctors, on their part, being enjoined to treat Villanovanus
gently and amiably, as parents treat their children.
Villanovanus is then expressly inhibited and
forbidden to appear in public, or in any other way, as
a professor or practitioner of judicial astrology, otherwise
called divination; he is to confine himself in his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
discussions of astrological subjects to the influence of
the heavenly bodies on the course of the seasons and
other natural phenomena, and not to meddle with
questions or judgments of stellar influences on individuals
or events, under pain of being deprived of the
privileges he enjoys as a graduate of the University of
Paris.</p>

<p>Done this 18th of March, 1538.

<p class="center">CHARLIEU&mdash;ATTAINMENT OF HIS THIRTIETH YEAR&mdash;HIS
VIEWS OF BAPTISM.</p>

<p>This decree and interdict of the Parliament of Paris
could not have been satisfactory to Servetus. We
need not question his belief in the reality of judicial
astrology, nor doubt of the application of its presumed
principles having been found profitable by him; for a
longing to pry into futurity is among the infirmities of
human nature, and a belief in the influence of the stars
on the fortunes of men was all but universal in the age
of Servetus. Nor is it even now entirely extinct in
the world; for the ‘Vox Stellarum’ is still regularly
printed in England, and finds a sale by thousands
every year among the superstitious and the ill-educated
of our population. Hardly, moreover, does a child
come into the world among us now without a great
fuss being made as to the precise moment of the birth;
though the particulars obtained may never be thought
of afterwards, nor the end for which they were sought
be even surmised. But when we look on the cornelian
and clay cylinders dug up in such numbers from the
ruins of Babylon and Nineveh, engraved with the accredited
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
figures of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, and the
emblematical representations of the constellations, such
as Cassiop&aelig;ia, Hercules Ingeniculus, Ursa Major, Leo,
Auriga, Cepheus, and others, still depicted on our
celestial globes, we learn how old was the belief that
every man and woman who came into the world was
influenced in after life by the star under which he or
she was born.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></p>

<p>Villeneuve might possibly have continued lecturing
on astrology, composing horoscopes, and casting nativities,
as others did in his day, had he but had the
prudence to control his tongue, and not hold up his
brethren of the Faculty of Physic to contempt by proclaiming
their ignorance of a science in which he himself
excelled and held necessary to treat disease in the
most effectual manner; but he had been indiscreet,
and they had won the day. He could no longer go
on making forecasts for a credulous public from the
aspect of the heavens at the moment of their birth,
and he must show himself forward to call in the unsold
copies of his pamphlet which had been found so offensive,
perhaps because so well directed and so true. It
would have interested us in the present day to have
known precisely wherein the sting of this apology lay;
but like others among the host of ephemeral publications,
hurriedly produced to serve a purpose of the
hour, it has perished. There were few collectors of
ballads, broadsides, and tracts, three hundred and fifty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
years ago; and all the searches for a copy of the philippic
against the Parisian Faculty have proved in vain.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></p>

<p>From the estimate we are led to form of the self-sufficing
and defiant character of Michael Servetus, as
displayed in his after life, we are disposed to wonder
that he did not continue to dispute the field of Paris
with his opponents. He had published his clever
and scholarly treatise on Syrups, and through it
achieved a title to consideration as a learned practitioner
of medicine in the regular way. Such a man as
he would soon have lived down the stigma his fellows
had fastened upon him as a fortune-teller from the
stars, and he must by and by have taken his place in
the front rank of his profession. But the physician
comes slowly into practice when public confidence is
courted through the gate of science. Horoscope-making
was probably the main source of Villeneuve’s income;
and this forbidden, and the golden stream it fed, arrested,
the cold shoulder shown him by his professional
brethren, and the averted looks of the public at the man
condemned by the Parliament of Paris,&mdash;all was against
him; his malignant star had culminated, and he seems
to have thought it best to yield to fate, and give way.</p>

<p>It must have been immediately after the conclusion
of the suit against him that Servetus left Paris; for
we have news of him in the course of the same year
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
(1538) as a practitioner of medicine in the town of
Charlieu, distant about twelve French miles from the
city of Lyons. He may have been led to this retreat
through knowledge gained in the course of his former
residence in Lyons; but he did not continue long there&mdash;certainly
for not more than a year and a half, or so.
Could we trust the report of one who speaks of him as
‘a most arrogant and insolent person,’ he must have
embroiled himself with some of the more influential
people of Charlieu, who, as said, made his position so
uncomfortable that he was forced to quit and go farther
afield.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> But Villeneuve had earned for himself an ill
name by his dispute with the University and Medical
Faculty of Paris; and coming from the quarter it does,
we give no credit to the tale, led as we are by what we
know to find a much better reason for the remove than
any fresh personal dispute, though there does seem to
have been something of the kind complicating matters,
as well as certain ‘love passages,’ which, as they came
to nothing, may have rendered longer residence in the
place unpleasant.</p>

<p>The residence of Villeneuve in Charlieu, however,
is not without interest, as giving us a further insight
into the character and predominant pious nature of the
man. In the course of the year 1539, which he passed
at Charlieu, Michael Servetus attained the thirtieth year
of his age, the year according to his religious tenets in
which only baptism could be rightly received. ‘He
who would follow the example of Christ,’ says he in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
his latest work, ‘ought now to betake him to this
Laver of Regeneration&mdash;<i>Lavacrum Regenerationis</i>;’
and from the particular account he gives of the manner
in which they who think with him on the subject of
baptism perform the rite, we can scarcely doubt of his
having found occasion to have himself privately baptized
by some Anabaptist acquaintance he had made.
Servetus was unquestionably a man of so pious a nature,
so sincere a believer in the divinity of Christ, according
to his way of interpreting it, and so firmly persuaded that
the closest possible imitation of him was necessary to
salvation, that we may feel assured he found means to
have a rite he held so indispensable properly performed
at the proper moment. It must have been in the consciousness
of having himself done what he thought right
in this particular, that we find him by and by urgently
exhorting Calvin, with whom he had entered into correspondence,
and probably knew to be of his own age,
to have himself baptized anew. ‘Christ,’ he says, ‘as
an infant, was circumcised, but not baptized; and this
is a great mystery; in his thirtieth year, however, he
received baptism; thereby setting us the example, and
teaching us that before this age no one is a fit recipient
of the rite that gives the kingdom of heaven to
man. It were fit and proper in you, therefore, would
you show true faith in Christ, to submit yourself to
baptism, and so receive the gift of the Holy Spirit promised
through this means.’ (Epist. xv. ad Jo. Calvinum,
Christ. Restit., p. 615.)

<p class="hang">SETTLEMENT AT VIENNE UNDER THE PATRONAGE OF THE
ARCHBISHOP&mdash;RENEWAL OF INTERCOURSE WITH THE
PUBLISHERS OF LYONS&mdash;SECOND EDITION OF PTOLEMY.</p>

<p>It was while resident at Charlieu that Villeneuve again
met with Pierre Paumier, now Archbishop of Vienne,
Dauphiny, whom he had known in Paris, who indeed
had been among the number of his auditors when he
lectured on geography and the science of the stars.
Paumier had the reputation, well deserved as it appears,
of being a lover of learning for its own sake,
and fond of the society of men learned like himself.
Thinking, we may presume, that one with the accomplishments
of his old professor would be an addition to
the society of the archiepiscopal city of Vienne, when
he heard of Villeneuve’s presence in Charlieu as a
practising physician, he sought him out, and pressed
him to quit the narrower for the wider field. This,
under such auspices, we can well imagine Doctor Villeneuve
was nowise loth to do; so that we next hear of
him installed at Vienne, with apartments found him in
the precincts of the Palace, and so under the immediate
patronage of the Archbishop.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span></p>

<p>Not overburthened with professional work at first,
Villeneuve appears to have renewed, if he had not
kept up, his connection with the publishers of Lyons;
and, as a means of income, continued his literary
labours in various directions for more than one of
the fraternity. Among other works, the edition of
‘Ptolemy’ he had supervised for the Trechsels, when
in their service in 1535, being exhausted, a second was
required; and their old editor having already proved
himself abundantly competent, overtures were made to
him to undertake the work anew. A proposal of the
kind we need not doubt was gladly received, and the
Trechsels having set up a branch establishment at
Vienne, and the Archbishop consenting to accept the
dedication of the new ‘Ptolemy,’ our editor had an
opportunity of saying something pleasant to his patron,
and of showing himself advantageously to the public
around him in connection with a handsome volume
from a press of their own city. The work accordingly
was entered on with alacrity; and as the editor was
not only countenanced, but assisted by the Archbishop,
himself no mean geographer, the new edition made
its appearance in the course of 1541, amended and
improved.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span></p>

<p>If the first ‘Ptolemy’ of Michael Villanovanus had
been seen as an improvement on its predecessors, his
second was a marked advance upon it, and is interesting
to us on many accounts. Though much lauded
and commercially successful, the first edition, in a
literary point of view, was still far from what it was
capable of being made. The ornamentation of the
volume, though profuse, was not highly artistic, and
the wood-cuts had already done duty in various other
publishing ventures. There was ample room for improvement
both in the direction of greater accuracy of
text and of better taste. In the re-issue, consequently,
we find various alterations, and two or three omissions
that are highly significant. It is printed on better
paper, too, and new maps are added; the coarse wood-cuts
are left out, and the text in various parts is
amended. Altogether the volume is a very handsome
one, and was obviously produced with every care to
secure accuracy and elegance.</p>

<p>In his Dedication to the Archbishop, we have an
assurance that life among the polished circles of Vienne
had already had a mollifying influence on the hot-headed
Michel Villeneuve of Parisian days. The polite
terms in which, beside the Archbishop, all and sundry
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
of mark and name in the city are spoken of, are particularly
notable. We know how little there was of
compliment in the words with which he took leave of
his Swiss opponents, and imagine the sting there must
be in the paper with which he bade the Parisian
Faculty farewell. But now, beneath the wing of the
great church dignitary, and referring to the time when
as professor of geography and astrology he had had
him among the number of his auditors, Villanovanus
tells us that he is especially encouraged in his purpose to
produce a more correct edition of the great geographer’s
work, by the permission he has received to dedicate
it to his patron, as well as by the assistance he has had
from him in the amendment of numerous faulty passages.</p>

<p>‘For you,’ continues our Editor, addressing the
Archbishop, ‘are the one among our church dignitaries
I have known who, loving letters and favouring learned
men, have given particular attention to geographical
science. I am also incited to my work by the many
favours I have received at your hand. Under what
patronage but yours, indeed, could this work, amended,
and printed at Vienne, appear, student as you are of
‘Ptolemy,’ and head of our Viennese society? Nor,
sooth to say, will our ‘Ptolemy’ want a welcome from
others about us interested in geography; among the
foremost of whom I may name your relation John
Paumier, prior of St. Marcel, and Claude de Rochefort,
your vicar, both of them highly accomplished men,
commended of all, and to whom I may say that I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
myself owe as much in my sphere as students of geography
owe to ‘Ptolemy.’ I must do no more than
mention Joannes Albus, prior of St. Peter and St.
Simeon; for I am forbidden to speak of his virtues.
Neither must I make other than a passing allusion to
the noble triad, your officials; for words would fail me
to speak worthily of their great qualities; and of
Doctor John Perell, your physician, my old fellow-student
in Paris, so learned in philosophy and skilled
in the languages&mdash;I can only say that one more apt
than I were required fitly to speak his praise.’</p>

<p>From this we learn that Michael Villanovanus, all
in laying on flattery somewhat thickly, could still show
himself the grateful man; as ready to acknowledge
kindness as we have known him apt to take fire at
opposition and ready to resent what he held to be
unworthy usage. But the matter is even more interesting
to us, as giving us to know the kind of society
Servetus frequented in Vienne, and the consequent
esteem in which he must have been held. The ‘noble
triad’ referred to, we imagine, may have consisted of
M. Maugiron, the Lieutenant-General of Dauphiny;
M. de la Cour, the Vibailly; and M. Arzelier, the
Vicar-General.</p>

<p>Among the alterations and omissions to be observed
in the new edition of the ‘Ptolemy,’ the most
notable occur under the heads of Germany, France,
and Jud&aelig;a. The edition of 1535 was set about and
produced shortly after he had been so unhandsomely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
received, as he thought, by the Swiss and German
Reformers; and we are therefore sorry, though not
surprised, to find that disappointment and pique had
left him with little inclination to say much in praise
either of themselves or their respective countries.
Hence the generally evil report he makes of Germany,
and the notice of Switzerland as remarkable for nothing
but the production of butchers! All this is either suppressed
or toned down in the edition of 1541. The
editor had had time for reflection; and under the soothing
influences of the archiepiscopal city and professional
success, he now makes a more favourable report
of the countries and peoples he had formerly gone out
of his way to decry and defame. Instead of the forest-encumbered
and swampy land with its inclement sky
of the former edition, Germany is now a <i>regio amœna</i>,
with a <i>cœlum satis clemens</i>&mdash;a pleasant country with
quite a temperate climate, and all the damaging statements
in regard to its several divisions and their
peoples are omitted.</p>

<p>The graphic account we had formerly of the boastful,
ignorant, and superstitious people of Spain is also
left out in the reprint; but we have an added notice of
the people of France which shows us how little nations
change in the course of three hundred and fifty years.
‘Not only in the cities and country places,’ says our
editor, ‘but even in single families, every Frenchman
seems to think he has a right to rule over everybody
else. The assertion of individual superiority is so universal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
that every one among them would have every
one else to do his bidding, he himself feeling bound to
do the bidding of none.’</p>

<p>The Church and her favoured sons, the hierarchs
thereof, having still thriven in the shadow of the
throne, as Villeneuve was now living amid the clerical
society of an archiepiscopal city, it was thought that
the few words in the former edition, which seemed to
question the efficacy of the ‘Royal Touch’ in curing
scrofula, would be out of place. They are, therefore,
now found modified. For the ‘I did not see that any
were cured,’ we find ‘I have heard say that many were
cured!’ The new edition, moreover, being dedicated
to the Archbishop of Vienne, it was felt that any word
in dispraise of the Holy Land would seem disrespectful
and improper. All that is said in connection with
the map of Palestine contradictory to the Bible account
of Jud&aelig;a as a land flowing with milk and honey, or as
of signal beauty and fertility, is accordingly entirely
expunged from the new impression.</p>

<p>These changes have been said to be due to warnings
given by friends to Servetus, on the presumption,
probably, that he could hardly have been living on
terms of intimacy with many persons of note, both lay
and clerical, without betraying something of the sceptical
element that distinguished him at the outset of
his career, and that got the mastery of him with such
disastrous consequences at last. But we have no positive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
intimation that Servetus ever failed to keep his
counsel, or that he was known to a soul in Vienne,
save as M. Michel Villeneuve, the physician. Calvin
certainly knew him by no other name in Paris when
they met there in 1534, a date at which we have surmised
he had not yet read the ‘De Erroribus Trinitatis,’
and so escaped having his suspicions aroused
through the sameness of the views propounded in that
work, and those expressed by his acquaintance, Villeneuve,
that he had its author, Michael Serveto, alias
Rev&eacute;s, bodily before him.</p>

<p>That this was really the case is confirmed by the
statement which he makes on his trial at Vienne, to
the effect, that he had only been challenged by
Calvin in the course of their correspondence, begun
as many as fourteen years after the publication
of his first book, with being no other than Servetus.
Having read the ‘De Erroribus’ subsequently, Calvin
did not fail to discover Michael Serveto under the
cloak of Michael Villanovanus, his correspondent of
Vienne, and may consequently, some time after the
year 1546, have written to Cardinal Tournon, as said
by Bolsec,<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> or hinted to a friend in Lyons, that they
had an egregious heretic, the writer of the work on
Trinitarian Error, living among them under an assumed
name. But of so much as this we have no
reliable assurance, and even if we had, it could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
have no reference to the year 1541, the date of
publication of the second edition of Villanovanus’s
‘Ptolemy.’<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span></p>

<h2 id="BOOK_I_CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<p class="center">EDITION OF SANTES PAGNINI’S LATIN BIBLE, WITH
COMMENTARY.</p>

<p>Servetus must have got through a very considerable
amount of literary work during the earlier years
of his residence at Vienne. His time not being then
fully occupied by professional duties, he had leisure
and certainly no lack of inclination for other work, so
that he seems to have been kept well employed by the
publishers of Lyons. Hardly had the second ‘Ptolemy’
seen the light, than we find another handsome volume
in folio not only taking shape under his hands,
but actually launched in the course of the following
year, 1542. This was a new and elegant edition of
the Latin Bible of the learned Santes Pagnini.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span></p>

<p>Appreciating the naturally pious bent of Servetus’s
mind, as we do, to edit the Bible, we imagine, must
to him have been like rest to the weary, and we think
of the delight with which he received the proposal of
Hugo de la Porte, the publisher of Lyons, to undertake
a task of the kind. In his own earliest work we have
seen him speaking of the Bible as a ‘book fallen down
from heaven, to be read a thousand times over, the
source of all his philosophy and of all his science.’
But this is from the pen of the younger man; for study
and after thought, with the privilege he possessed
through his self-reliant spirit of reading without a foregone
conclusion, enabled him by and by to discover
that the accredited traditional interpretation of holy
writ could not at all times be maintained without violence,
not only to reason and experience, but to history
and the plain meaning of the text. He came to the
conclusion, in fact, that whilst the usual prophetical
bearing ascribed to the Old Testament was ever to be
kept in view, the text had a primary, literal, and immediate
reference to the age in which it was composed,
and to the personages, the events, and the circumstances
amid which its writers lived.</p>

<p>In the Preface to his edition, consequently, we see
that, having undertaken the responsible duty of editor,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
Villanovanus means to be no mere follower in the
beaten track, but to take an independent course of
his own. ‘They,’ he says, ‘who are ignorant of the
Hebrew language and history are only too apt to overlook
the historical and literal sense of the sacred Scriptures;
the consequence of which is that they vainly
and foolishly expend themselves in hunting after recondite
and mystical meanings in the text where
nothing of the kind exists.’ Before reading the prophets,
in particular, he would therefore ‘have every
one make himself acquainted not only with the Hebrew
tongue, but with Hebrew history; for the prophets,
without exception, followed history to the letter,
although they also prefigured future events in their
writings, led as they were by inspiration to conclusions
having reference to the mystery of Christ. The power
of the Scriptures, indeed, is of a fertilizing or prolific
kind. Under a waning literal sense, they possess a
vivifying spirit of renovation. It were, therefore, well
that their meaning, apprehended as pointing in one
direction, should not be overlooked as also pointing in
another; and this the rather, seeing that the historical
sense comes out ever the more clearly when the prospective
bearing, which has Christ for its object, is kept
in view&mdash;veiled under types and figures, indeed, and
so not seen of the Jews, blinded by their prejudices,
but now revealed to us in such wise that we seem to
see the very face of our God.’</p>

<p>‘In our Commentaries,’ concludes the Expositor,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
‘it will consequently be found that we have made it our
particular study to elicit and present the old historical,
but hitherto neglected, sense of the Scriptures. In this
view, and to make available the author’s annotations,
of which he has left a great many, we have taken no
small amount of pains&mdash;<i>non parum est nobis desudatum</i>.
Nor, indeed, had we to do with his annotations only;
for the text of the copy we followed is corrected in
numberless places by the hand of the author himself.
I may, therefore, venture to affirm that Pagnini’s translation,
as it now appears, approximates more closely to
the meaning and spirit of the Hebrew than any former
version. But the Church, and those learned in the
Hebrew tongue, must be the judges here&mdash;any others
are incompetent.’</p>

<p>From what he says, Villanovanus would therefore
lead us to believe that he had had the privilege of
working from a copy corrected and annotated by Pagnini
himself, the author of the translation. But on a
somewhat careful collation of the Villanovanus edition
of 1542 with that of Lyons of 1527-28 (the <i>editio princeps</i>,
we apprehend), and the reprint from this by Melchior
Novesianus of Cologne, of 1541, we are forced
on the conviction that Villanovanus followed no copy
corrected and annotated by Pagnini, but the fine edition
of Novesianus, admirably edited by the learned
publisher himself. The text of this is in fact identical
with that of Villanovanus, and the headings to the
chapters and references to corresponding and corroborative
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
texts are all but uniformly alike in the two.
There are no variorum readings, if we recollect aright,
in the Novesianus; but neither are there any of the
slightest significance in the Villanovanus&mdash;unless perchance
the reader should think that the text is improved
by Noah being directed in building the Ark to
‘pitch it with pitch’&mdash;<i>picabis eam pice</i>, instead of bitumen&mdash;<i>bituminabis
eam bitumine</i>!</p>

<p>That Villanovanus followed Novesianus, and not any
copy corrected and annotated by Pagnini, is, as it were,
demonstrated by this, that each page of the Address
to the Reader, with the single exception of the first,
begins and ends with the very same word in the two
editions&mdash;which could not have been accidental: the
compositor followed the copy he worked from page for
page, line for line, word for word. We are sorry,
therefore, to find our editor taking credit to himself in
directions where none was due, and seeking, as it
might seem, to shelter himself under the pious cowl of
the orthodox Pagnini for the new and daring interpretation
he himself puts upon so many passages of the
Psalms and Prophets. Pagnini, one of the most learned
hebraists and classical scholars of his country, was also
a thoroughly orthodox monk, and would assuredly
have been not a little astonished, and hardly pleased,
we imagine, could he have seen himself in the guise in
which he is presented by Michael Villanovanus. Had
we but a single note from the hand of the learned
Italian&mdash;and to the best of our belief we have not one&mdash;it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
could not have failed to be of the most rigidly
orthodox kind, his own edition having the <i>imprimatur</i>
of no fewer than two Popes, and a laudatory epistle
from Jo. Franciscus Picus, nephew of the celebrated
Joannes Picus de Mirandola, distinguished alike as a
philosopher and theologian.</p>

<p>Villanovanus’s procedure in respect of the Pagnini
Bible, on the face of the matter, is much to be regretted,
and indeed is hardly to be understood. He may
possibly have had an annotated copy of his author supplied
him by his publisher; but if he had, in so far as
we can see, he has followed Novesianus to the letter
in his text and has given no comments but his own.
The times in which Servetus lived, though different
from ours in so many respects, were, as it seems, somewhat
like them in so far as the <i>meum</i> and <i>tuum</i> in
literature are concerned. Did we judge from the instance
before us, we should say that they were still
less respected three hundred years ago than they are
in the present day. Calvin refers to Villanovanus’s
‘Pagnini’ in the course of the Geneva trial, and subsequently
also in his ‘D&eacute;claration pour maintenir la
vraye foye.’ But he seems not to have known of the
Novesianus edition, or he would certainly have challenged
more than the comments, and had better grounds
possibly than any he adduces for saying that the editor
had dexterously filched&mdash;<i>avait gripp&eacute; beau et belle</i>&mdash;five
hundred livres from the publisher for his labour.</p>

<p>But all this, though illustrative of one element in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
the character of the subject of our study, and not to be
passed over by us, is of less moment than the insight
we gain through the comments&mdash;assuredly referable to
him alone&mdash;into the intellectual side of his nature. In
so far as we know, Servetus is nowhere even named as
a biblical critic and expositor; yet did he precede by
more than a century Spinoza, Astruc, Simon, Eichhorn,
and others, founders of the modern school of
Scriptural exegesis. The Old Testament texts referred
by the writers of the New Testament to events
still in the womb of time&mdash;to the coming especially of
a liberator from their misery for the people of Israel in
the shape of an anointed King, the conception of a
late epoch in Jewish history&mdash;Servetus maintained had
individuals in view who were alive and influential
when the words were written, although he also admitted
that they had a further prophetical or prospective
sense of the kind commonly ascribed to them.</p>

<p>But he who believed in judicial astrology was not
likely to have freed himself from that other still accredited
form of superstitious belief which leads mankind,
without so much as the aspects of the heavens to guide
them, to fancy they can see into futurity. He had not
divined, as we have now come to know, that even the
oldest portions of the Hebrew Scriptures, in the shape
in which they have reached us, date from no more
remote an age than that which followed the Babylonian
Captivity; that we have the work of two different
writers under the name of Isaiah, the second of whom
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
lived during or after the reign of Cyrus; and that the
Apocalyptic Book of Daniel was written long after
the personages there darkly shadowed forth had lived
and died, and the events referred to had come and
gone.</p>

<p>The narratives of the Pentateuch appear to have
been accepted as properly historical by our editor.
He did not, any more than the commentators who came
after him almost to our own day, see them as mythical
tales about individuals who lived, if they lived at all,
and events that occurred, if they ever did occur,
thousands&mdash;tens of thousands of years before any
account of them could possibly have assumed the
shape of legend, much less have been committed to
writing. He has little, however, to say on the five
books ascribed to Moses, and those of the quasi-historical
complexion that follow them. Still his note on the
words put into the mouth of Balaam, which tell of <i>a
star to come out of Jacob and a sceptre to arise out of
Israel</i>, is important. The prediction, as he interprets
it, applies immediately to King David, though it has a
farther prospective reference to Christ, with whose
advent, as we know, it has long been all but exclusively
connected. Our editor, however, was not helped by
his superior knowledge of the stars to surmise that the
writing was of a date long posterior to the reputed
days of Balaam, the soothsayer of Mesopotamia, and
Balak, king of Moab; that the predictions put into the
mouth of the seer were all made after the events they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
pretend to foretell, and that King David had lived and
died long before a word of the text was written;
neither did he see that the writer who had King David
in his eye could not have been thinking of an anointed
king or captain who was only to appear some six or
seven hundred years after Israel’s second sovereign
had been gathered to his fathers.</p>

<p>Villanovanus is much more copious when he comes
to the Psalms. The words in the second of our collection
of these sacred lyrics, so much made of in dogmatic
lore, <i>Yet have I set my King upon my holy hill
of Zion.... Thou art my son; this day have I begotten
thee</i>&mdash;he explains thus: ‘On the day when David
had escaped from his enemy (Saul) he said, This day
do I begin to live; at length I am king.’</p>

<p>The words in the fifth verse of that fine Psalm, the
eighth, <i>For thou hast made him a little lower than the
angels, and hast crowned him with honour and glory</i>, he
also refers immediately to King David, who, in times
of persecution, abased himself; but, subsequently victorious,
was crowned at last.</p>

<p>The passages, <i>In Jehovah I put my trust</i>, and
<i>How say ye to my soul, flee as a bird to your mountain</i>,
of Psalm xi., he refers to the time when David in
fear of Saul escaped from the land of Judah.</p>

<p>The comment on the sixteenth verse of Psalm xxii.,
<i>They pierced my hands and my feet</i>, is again applied to
David, when, flying from his enemies, and scrambling
like a four-footed beast over rugged and thorny places,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
his hands and feet were lacerated&mdash;<i>fugiente David per
abrupta, instar quadrupedis, manus ejus et pedes lacerabantur</i>.</p>

<p><i>Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire</i>&mdash;Psalm
xl. 6, signifies, says our commentator, that David, when
a fugitive in the wilderness, offered no sacrifices.</p>

<p>In the verse, <i>Thy throne, O God, is for ever and
ever</i>, Psalm xlv. 6, the word <i>God</i>, says our exponent,
refers to Solomon, who, like Moses and Cyrus, is here
styled <i>Divus</i>&mdash;God.</p>

<p><i>They gave me gall for my meat, and in my thirst
they gave me vinegar as drink</i>, of Psalm xlix. 22, says
Villanovanus, is a passage referring to Nabal’s refusal
and churlishness when David asked him for meat and
drink.</p>

<p><i>The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right
hand until I make thine enemies thy footstool</i>, Psalm cx. 1.
‘This refers to David and Solomon, types alike of
Christ, when David, having set his son on the throne
beside him, addressed him as My Lord, and styled him
a priest after the order of Melchizedek.’</p>

<p>Whilst thus in these and in many other instances
referring the statements met with in the Psalms to
individuals living or dead at the time they were
written, and to events then in progress or past, Villanovanus
still imagines that everything said, besides
its literal and immediate signification, is also typical of
personages and events to come&mdash;a system of exposition
that has been pushed beyond all reasonable lengths by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
ignorance and superstition since his day. We may
indeed be well assured that the writers of the Hebrew
Psalms knew no more of what would happen five or
six centuries after they were dust than we know of what
will be going on in the world five or six hundred years
after we are no more. Prophets, Seers, Diviners, Fortune-tellers
and the like are ignored by the science of
our age, although under the first of these designations
they are still acknowledged by pious persons in the
history of the past, and in its bearing on the religion of
the present. The excuse for this is that the Prophets
of Israel were <i>inspired</i>, or exceptionally gifted, with
the power of seeing into futurity. But God, as we
now conceive God, makes no exceptions to his laws.
As they are, so have they ever been, and so will they
ever continue to be. Said not Servetus himself aright
when he declared that out of man there was no Holy
Spirit, or Spirit of Inspiration?</p>

<p>But it is not on the Psalms that Villanovanus’s exposition,
remarkable as it is, appears the most noteworthy.
It is when he comes to the writings of the
Prophets, as they are styled, that he puts forth his
strength and shows his learning. <i>And it shall come
to pass in the last days that Jehovah’s house shall be
established on the top of the mountain, and all nations
shall flow unto it</i>, says Isaiah (ii. 2 <i>et seq.</i>). These
words, according to our expositor, refer to the reign of
Hezekiah. Literally seen, they speak of the accession
of Hezekiah, and the return of the captive Israelites
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
to Jerusalem, the Assyrians having suffered a signal
defeat without a battle fought.</p>

<p>In like manner, commenting on the second verse of
the fourth chapter of Isaiah, where it is said, <i>In that
day shall the branch of Jehovah be beautiful and
glorious</i>, he says it is still Hezekiah and events transpiring
in his reign that are alluded to, the king nevertheless
being to be seen as a type of Christ.</p>

<p>The remarkable fourteenth verse of chapter vii.
of the same writer, of which so much has been made,
Villanovanus refers immediately to the times in which
it was written. Syria and Ephraim confederate, under
their kings Rezin and Pekah, are at war with Judah
and threatening Jerusalem, whose king, Ahaz, the
Prophet comforts with the assurance that the invasion,
however formidable it looks, will come to nothing, and
bids him ask for a sign from Jehovah that such will be
the case. But Ahaz declining to do so, the Prophet
volunteers a forecast of what he declares will come
to pass, saying, <i>Behold, a virgin</i> (Almah&mdash;a young
marriageable woman) <i>shall conceive and bear a son, and
shall call his name Immanuel; and before the child shall
know good from evil</i> [arrive at years of discretion] <i>the
land will be freed from its enemies</i>. ‘The Aram&aelig;ans,’
says Villanovanus, ‘have come up in battle array against
Jerusalem, and the prophet speaks of a young woman
who shall conceive and bear a son, the young woman
being no other than Abijah, about to become the
mother of Hezekiah&mdash;strength or fortitude of God&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
Immanuel&mdash;God with us&mdash;before whose reign the two
kings, the enemies of Judah, will have been discomfited.’</p>

<p>The <i>For unto us a child is born</i>, &amp;c., of chapter ix.,
he further refers to Hezekiah, for it was in his reign
that Sennacherib and the Assyrians suffered such a
signal defeat, the angel of Jehovah, according to the
account, having slain in one night an hundred and four
score and five thousand of them.</p>

<p><i>For they shall cry unto the Lord of Hosts in the
land of Egypt, and he will send them a Saviour and he
shall deliver them</i> (Ib. xix. 20). ‘The Saviour,’ says
Villanovanus, ‘is still no other than Hezekiah. Egypt
as well as Judah, oppressed by the Assyrians, is relieved
when the great army of Sennacherib is wrecked by the
angel of Jehovah.’</p>

<p><i>Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the
ears of the deaf be unstopped</i> (Ib. xxxv. 5), <i>i.e.</i> ‘Liberation
from the yoke of the Assyrians will do much
towards giving the Jewish people clearer and better
ideas of God.’</p>

<p><i>Comfort ye my people.... The voice of one crying
in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord</i>, &amp;c.
(Ib. xl. 1-3). ‘These are words addressed to Cyrus,
praying him to open a way through the desert
for Israel, returning from the captivity of Babylon;’
and the ninth verse, <i>O Zion, that bringest good
tidings ... say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your
God</i>, he says, ‘refers literally to Cyrus, who is here
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
styled God; as does also the eighteenth verse, <i>To
whom will ye liken God</i> (<i>i.e.</i> Cyrus), <i>or what likeness
will ye compare unto him</i>? ‘In many striking ways,’
adds our expositor, ‘the prophet would lead the rude
Jews, on their redemption from the Babylonian captivity,
to cease from idolatry and to believe in God, the
Creator of the world.’</p>

<p><i>He is despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows
and acquainted with grief. Surely he hath borne
our griefs ... he was wounded for our transgressions</i>,
&amp;c. (Ib. liii.). ‘In these passages, which also involve
a great mystery referable to Christ,’ says Villanovanus,
‘the Prophet laments over Cyrus, slain, as it were, for
the sins of the people, who, however, will suffer still
more under Cambyses, his successor, when the building
of the Temple, now begun, will be interrupted.’</p>

<p><i>Arise, shine, for thy light is come.... They from
Sheba shall come, and shall bring gold and incense</i>, &amp;c.,
(Ib. lx.), <i>i.e.</i> ‘taken literally, and as it stands, these words
refer to the great days of the Second Temple, when
Jerusalem was again in its glory.’</p>

<p><i>Who is this that cometh from Edom with dyed
garments from Bozrah</i> (Ib. lxiii.), <i>i.e.</i> ‘Cyrus has inflicted
severe chastisement on Edom, and brought back
those who had been carried thither from Jerusalem into
captivity, as we read in the fifteenth chapter, where it
is said, <i>The redeemed of the Lord shall return, and
come with singing unto Zion.</i>’</p>

<p><i>Behold the days will come, saith the Lord, when I</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
<i>shall raise unto David a righteous branch</i> (Jerem.
xxiii. 5). The individual here referred to our exponent
believes to be Zerubabel.</p>

<p><i>Know, therefore, that from the going forth of the
commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto
the Messiah, the Prince, is seven weeks, and three-score
and two weeks ... and after three-score and two weeks
shall Messiah be cut off and be no more</i> (Daniel, ix. 25).
‘The times specified,’ says Villanovanus, ‘refer to
those of the exile and the return of the captives by
favour of Cyrus, who is the Messiah or Anointed
One of God, that is here spoken of. Sixty-two
weeks having passed from the great event, Cyrus
will have been cut off, and all have gone to wreck
again.’</p>

<p><i>Then shall Judah and Israel be gathered together,
and appoint themselves one head</i>, &amp;c., <i>i.e.</i> ‘Judah and
Israel will have become united for a season, as they
were under Hezekiah.’</p>

<p>The words of the second verse of chapter vi.,
<i>After two days will he revive us; in the third day he
will raise us up</i>, ‘refer to the extraordinary discomfiture
of the Assyrians in the reign of Hezekiah.’</p>

<p><i>For behold, in those days when I shall bring again
the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem, I will also gather
all the nations</i>, &amp;c. (Joel, iii. 1). ‘These words have
a literal application to the defeat of the Assyrians and
the glories of Hezekiah’s reign. Disasters many have
befallen the chosen seed; but their oppressors will in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
turn be desolated, and Judah, restored, shall dwell for
ever in Jerusalem.’</p>

<p>The texts in <span class="smcap">Micah</span> generally spoken of as exclusively
prophetical of Christ, our commentator thinks
refer literally to Hezekiah and times subsequent to the
defeat of the Assyrians. <i>But thou, Bethlehem-Ephratah,
out of thee shall he come forth to be a ruler in
Israel</i>, viz., ‘Hezekiah, who will deliver the people from
the Assyrian.’</p>

<p><i>Rejoice greatly, O Daughter of Zion; shout, O
Daughter of Jerusalem; behold, thy King cometh unto
thee lowly, and riding upon an ass, even on a colt, the
foal of an ass.</i> This text, which is referred to Christ
in Matthew (chapter xxii.), is connected by Villanovanus
with the compassionate Zerubabel and his entrance
into Jerusalem.</p>

<p>No one will be surprised to learn that these
comments of the learned Villanovanus did not escape
the notice of the great ecclesiastical centres of his day.
That of Lyons is by-and-by found condemning outright
both them and the book they pretend to illustrate.
That of Madrid is content to order by far the greater
number of the glosses to be expunged, but leaves the
Bible itself available to the privileged; whilst that of
Rome, less tolerant, not only condemns the expositions,
but puts the book upon the <i>Index prohibitorius</i>. The
perusal of such comments, preparatory to drawing the
pen through them, it was surmised by the far-sighted
ecclesiastics of Rome might lead to independent thought,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
and this is precisely what the Church they represent
would have every man, woman, and child in the land
most carefully to eschew.</p>

<p>Calvin, we may imagine, was not likely to think
any better of Villanovanus’s annotations than the heads
of the Church of Rome; on the contrary, pinning his
faith on its text as prophetical in the very strictest sense
of the word, any attack on its sufficiency as a ground
for dogmatic conclusion was felt by him to be a matter
much more serious than by the Church of Rome,
which sets its own traditions as equipollent to, where not
even of higher authority than, that of the Bible on all
matters of faith. To see the Scriptures of the Jews
otherwise than as Calvin and the Reformers saw them
was, in their eyes, to question the infallible book they
had substituted for the infallible Pope so lately abandoned
by them. We should therefore expect to meet
Calvin, with occasion serving, making a point against
our expositor on the ground of the Pagnini; and accordingly
we find Servetus’s comments brought up
against him in the most marked manner during his
Geneva Trial, whilst in the D&eacute;claration pour maintenir
la vraye Foye, and the Defensio orthodox&aelig; Fidei, they
are spoken of as impertinences and impieties, the
Publisher being said at the same time to have been
nothing less than cheated out of the money he paid the
editor for his work. ‘Who,’ says Calvin, ‘shall venture
to say that it was not thievish in the editor when he
took five hundred livres in payment for the vain trifles
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
and impious follies with which he encumbered almost
every page of the book?’ (‘Opusc. Theol. Om.’ p. 703).</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the great Reformer’s denunciations,
however, though we may not agree with Villanovanus
in all his conclusions, nor approve of his passing without
mention Melchior Novesianus, to whom he was
indebted for his text, when we look on the beautiful
volume he aided in producing, and think of him as
the one man of his age who had independent opinions
on the real or possible meaning of the poetical writings
of the Hebrew people, consonant as these are in
so many respects with the views entertained by the
most advanced biblical critics of the present day, we
are not disposed to think that he was overpaid. Had
the Church dignitaries of Vienne seen the Pagnini Bible
of Michael Villanovanus with the same eyes as the
hierarchs of Rome, Madrid, and Lyons, the matter he
added must needs have seriously compromised him
with them. His numerous, excessively free, and
highly heterodox interpretations of the Psalms and
Prophets, nevertheless, in so far as we have been able
to discover, appear to have lost Villeneuve neither
countenance nor favour at Vienne, which is not a little
extraordinary.

<h2 id="BOOK_I_CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<p class="center">ENGAGEMENT AS EDITOR BY JO. FRELON OF LYONS&mdash;CORRESPONDENCE
WITH CALVIN.</p>

<p>The Pagnini Bible out of hand, Villanovanus’s time
would seem not yet to have been so fully occupied by
his profession as to debar him from continuing to
engage in a good deal of miscellaneous literary work
for his friends the publishers of Lyons, among the
number of whom we have now particularly to notice
John Frelon, a man of learning, like so many of the
old publishers, entertaining tolerant or more liberal
views of the religious question, inclined towards, if not
openly professing, the Reformed Faith, and the personal
friend of Calvin.</p>

<p>For Frelon Villeneuve edited a variety of works,
mostly, as it seems, of an educational kind, such as
grammars, accidences, and the like; translating several
of these from Latin into Spanish, for the laity; and, as
the priesthood of the Peninsula appear not to have
cultivated the classical languages of Greece and Rome
to the same extent as those of France and Germany,
also turning the <i>Summa Theologi&aelig;</i> of St. Thomas
Aquinas, a work entitled <i>Desiderius peregrinus</i>, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
another, the <i>Thesaurus anim&aelig; Christian&aelig;</i>, into their
vernacular for them.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> Brought into somewhat intimate
relationship with Villeneuve, whom Frelon at this
time could not have known as Michael Servetus, the
Reformation, its principles, its objects, and the views
of its more distinguished leaders, would hardly fail to
come up as topics of conversation between him and
his learned editor. Frelon must soon have seen how
much better than common Villeneuve was informed in
this direction; and it has been said, not without every
show of truth, that at his suggestion Servetus, under
his assumed name of Villeneuve or Villanovanus, was
led to enter on the correspondence with Calvin which
we believe had so momentous an influence on his future
fate. Frelon saw Villeneuve full of unusual ideas on
many of the accredited dogmas of the Christian faith;
and, not indisposed, though indifferently prepared, to
discuss these himself, he very probably suggested the
great Reformer of Geneva as the man of all others the
most likely to feel an interest in them, as well as the
most competent to give an opinion on their merits.
Hence the correspondence which, begun in 1546, went
on into 1547, and may even have extended into the
following year.</p>

<p>That Frelon was the medium of communication
between Villeneuve and Calvin is satisfactorily shown
by the publisher’s letter to the Spaniard, inclosing one
for him just received from the Reformer. The correspondence,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
however, must have already been started
and Villeneuve been complaining to Frelon that he
had been long without an answer to the last of his
letters. Frelon, in turn, would seem to have written to
Calvin, reminding him that his friend Villeneuve had
for some time past been expecting to hear from him.
Writing at length under his well-known pseudonym of
Charles Despeville, in reply to Frelon, Calvin says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘Seigneur Jehan, Your last letter found me on the eve of
my departure from home, and I had not time then to reply to
the inclosure it contained. I take advantage of the first
moment I have to spare since my return, to comply with your
wishes; not indeed that I have any great hope of proving
serviceable to such a man, seeing him disposed as I do. But
I will try once more if there be any means left of bringing him
to reason, and this will happen when God shall have so worked
in him that he become altogether other than he is. I have
been led to write to him more sharply than is my wont, being
minded to take him down a little in his presumption; and
I assure you there is no lesson he needs so much to learn as
humility. This may perhaps come to him through the grace
of God, not otherwise, as it seems. But we too ought to lend
a helping hand. If God give him and us such grace as to
have the letter I now forward turn to profit, I shall have
cause to rejoice. If he goes on writing to me in the style he
has hitherto seen fit to use, however, you will only lose your
time in soliciting me farther in his behalf; for I have other
business that concerns me more nearly, and I shall make it
matter of conscience to devote myself to it, not doubting that
he is a Satan who would divert me from studies more profitable.
Let me beg of you therefore to be content with what I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
have already done, unless you see most pressing occasion for
acting differently.</p>

<p>‘Recommending myself to you and praying God to have
you in his keeping, I am your servant and friend&mdash;</p>

<p class="author">‘<span class="smcap">Charles Despeville</span>.</p>

<p>[Geneva] ‘this 13 of February, 1546.’</p></blockquote>

<p>This is surely neither an indifferent nor an unreasonable
letter; yet does it give us to know that the
epistle it enclosed, both in manner and matter, was
likely to give offence to one with the haughty and self-sufficing
nature of Michael Servetus. He had addressed
the Reformer on transcendental dogmatic
subjects, and probably urged his views with the warmth
that strong conviction lends to language, and without
anything like the deferential tone to which Calvin was
accustomed. This proved particularly distasteful to
the head of the Church of Geneva, who had certainly
thought as deeply, and may even have entertained
as serious misgivings, on some of the topics
propounded, as his correspondent. Hence the unwonted
<i>sharpness</i> of the reply; hence, also, the fire which
Villeneuve caught at being lectured like a schoolboy;
and hence, in fine, the irritating, disrespectful, and regrettable
character on either side of the correspondence
that followed.</p>

<p>In transmitting Calvin’s letter to Villeneuve, Frelon
addresses him thus:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘Dear Brother and Friend! You will see by the enclosed
why you had not sooner an answer to your letter. Had I
had anything to communicate at an earlier date, I should not
have failed to send to you immediately, as I promised. Be
assured that I wrote to the personage in question, and that
there was no want of punctuality on my part. I think, however,
that with what you have now, you will be as well content
as if you had had it sooner. I send my own man express with
this, having no other messenger at command. If I can be
of use to you in anything else, I beg to assure you, you will
always find me ready to serve you. Your good brother and
friend, Jehan Frelon.</p>

<p>‘To my good brother and friend, master Michael Villanovanus,
Doctor in medicine, Vienne.’</p></blockquote>

<p>It is matter of deep regret that with the exception
of the first communication of Calvin to Villeneuve,
which is in the form of an essay rather than a familiar
epistle, and was written some time before the stinging
missive sent through Frelon, we have nothing from
him that would have enabled us to judge of the general
style and character of his letters, though of this we
may form an estimate from his subsequent writings.
Calvin was far too much engaged to make copies of
his letters, and we may feel certain that Villeneuve,
on the first intimation of danger threatening him from
the authorities of Vienne, destroyed every scrap of
writing he had ever had from the Reformer, calculated
as it was to compromise him in the eyes of Roman
Catholics. Forced, for the sake of his French correspondents,
to resort to a pseudonym, Calvin had probably
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
addressed Villeneuve in his proper name. The
letter to Frelon and the one from Frelon to Villeneuve
must have been overlooked, or thought to contain
nothing that could be adversely interpreted, and so
found their way to the Judicial Archives of Vienne,
whence they were recovered and published by
Mosheim.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></p>

<p>The letters of Villeneuve to Calvin, or a certain
number of them, at all events, have been transmitted to
us by their writer in a section of his work on the Restoration
of Christianity; and we turned to them with the
interest of expectation, thinking we might there find
a key to the singular and persistent hostility with
which Calvin shows himself to have been animated
towards his correspondent. Nor were we disappointed.
The style of address indulged in by Villeneuve, as the
correspondence proceeds, is as if purposely calculated
to wound, if not even to insult, a man in the position of
John Calvin, conscious of his own superiority, jealous
of his authority, and become so sensitive to everything
like disrespectful bearing on the part of those who
approached him. But of deference or respect, save at
the outset, there is not a trace in any of the letters of
Villeneuve. On the contrary, they have often an air
of something like familiarity that must have been
extremely disagreeable to Calvin. Add to this the
unseemly and disparaging epithets with which he pelts
the irritable Reformer, and we have warrant enough
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
for our assumption that, mainly out of this unfortunate
epistolary encounter, was the enmity engendered which
took such hold of Calvin’s mind as led him to see in a
mere theological dissident a dangerous innovator and
deadly personal foe.</p>

<p>The correspondence at the outset, however, had
nothing of the unseemly character it acquired as it
proceeded. Villeneuve approached the Reformer at
first as one seeking aid and information from another
presumed most capable of giving both; and this was
precisely the style of address that suited Calvin. The
subjects on which he desired the Reformer’s opinion
were theological, of course, and of great gravity,
involving topics of no less moment than the sense in
which the Divinity and Sonship of Christ, the Doctrine
of Regeneration, and the Sacraments of Baptism and
the Lord’s Supper, were to be understood.</p>

<p>In a letter to a friend of a later date Calvin speaks
as if he believed that these questions had been proposed
in mockery, or to get him into difficulty; but
this was an afterthought, and when he had come to
persuade himself that Servetus was a man devoid of
all religious principle. Nothing of any suspicion of the
kind he hints at appears in his reply to the first communication
he received, for it is sober, earnest, and to
the point, each subject being taken up in succession
and discussed, now in conformity with his own particular
views, and then with the interpretation of the
Churches.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span></p>

<p>Servetus’s questions to Calvin, three in number,
were propounded categorically, and in the following
order:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st.&mdash;Was the man Jesus, who was crucified, the
Son of God; and what is the rationale of the Sonship
(filiatio)?</p>

<p>2nd.&mdash;Is the Kingdom of heaven in man; when is
it entered; and when is regeneration effected?</p>

<p>3rd.&mdash;Is Baptism to be received in faith, like the
Supper; and in what sense are these institutions to
be held as the New Covenant?</p>

<p>To the first, Calvin replies: ‘We believe and
confess that Jesus Christ, the man who was crucified,
was the Son of God, and say that the Wisdom of God,
born of the Eternal Father before all time, having
become incarnate, was now manifested in the flesh.
Therefore do we acknowledge Christ to be the Son of
God by his humanity; therefore, also, do we say that he
is God&mdash;<i>sed ideo quod Deus</i>. As by his human nature,
he is engendered of the seed of David, and so is said
to be the Son of David; by parity of reason, and
because of his divine nature, is he the Son of God.
Christ, however, is One, not Two-fold; he is at once the
Son of God and the Son of Man. You own him as
the Son of God, but do not admit the oneness, save in
a confused way. We, who say that the Son of God is
our Brother, as well as the true Immanuel, nevertheless
acknowledge in the One Christ the Majesty of God and
the Humility of man. But you, confounding these,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
destroy both; for, acknowledging God manifest in the
flesh, you say the divinity is the flesh itself, the
humanity God Himself.’</p>

<p>To the second he answers: ‘The Kingdom of God,
we say, begins in men when they are regenerated;
and we are said to be regenerated when, enlightened
by faith in Christ, we yield entire obedience to God.
I deny, however, that regeneration takes place in a
moment; it is enough if progress be made therein even
to the hour of death.’</p>

<p>To the third he says: ‘We do not deny that
Baptism requires faith; but not such as is required in
the communion of the Supper; and in respect of
Baptism we see it as nugatory until the promise of
God involved in the rite is apprehended in faith.’ He
concludes by assimilating the sacraments of Baptism
and the Lord’s Supper to the Circumcision and Passover
of the olden time.</p>

<p>Calvin, we thus see, addressed himself not only to
the questions sent, but also in answer to the letter which
doubtless accompanied them, in which the writer must
have given some intimation of his own views.</p>

<p>That Calvin’s communication, couched in rigidly
orthodox terms, though unobjectionable in style, was
not calculated to satisfy Villeneuve, we cannot doubt.
His mind was already as thoroughly made up&mdash;even
more thoroughly made up, we apprehend, on some of
the points advanced&mdash;than Calvin’s. We are not surprised,
therefore, to find that the Genevese Reformer’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
expositions were repudiated as little satisfactory by the
physician of Vienne, or to discover that the correspondence
on his part was not suffered to drop. He appears
to have replied immediately, and must have written in
sequence no fewer than thirty letters to Calvin on his
favourite theological subjects, so many being printed
in the ‘Christianismi Restitutio.’ In answer to these
Calvin must also have sent him more than one or two,
though certainly many fewer than thirty; for by the
letter to Frelon, written evidently at an early period
of the correspondence, we see him already weary
of it.</p>

<p>With his hands more than full in administering the
affairs of the Genevese Church, holding his political
opponents the Libertines in check at home, and corresponding
with friends and the heads of all the other
Reformed Churches abroad, it is not wonderful that,
besides feeling disquieted by the matter and offended
with the manner of Villeneuve’s addresses, he had soon
made up his mind to have nothing more to do with the
writer. He saw, moreover, that he made no impression
on him, each new epistle being, as he says to
a friend, but ‘a wearisome iteration of the same cuckoo
note.’ Calvin’s vocation, however, was to be helpful
in what he believed to be God’s work, and to preach
the Gospel as he apprehended it. True to his trust,
therefore, and by way of meeting his troublesome correspondent’s
further importunities,&mdash;as a balsam competent
to heal the wounds and strengthen the weak
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
places in the soul of the distempered man, he seems to
have thought he might escape further molestation by
referring him to his own ‘Institutions of the Christian
Religion,’ his master work, the canon of the Church of
which he was the founder and acknowledged head. In
this view, as we venture to presume, Calvin sent
Villeneuve a copy of his ‘Institutions,’ and referred
him to its pages for satisfactory replies to all his propositions.</p>

<p>It is impossible to imagine that Servetus had continued
until this time unacquainted with Calvin’s writings;
he had doubtless read them all; but he may not
have made the ‘<span class="smcap">Institutiones Religionis Christian&aelig;</span>’
the subject of the particular study on which he was
now forced, as it were, by its author, and with the result
that might have been foreseen: there was hardly
a proposition in the text that was not taken to pieces
by him, and found untenable, on the ground both of
Scripture and Patristic authority.</p>

<p>In the course of the correspondence hitherto, Calvin
had stood on the vantage ground, as critic of his correspondent’s
views; but matters were now reversed, for
Villeneuve became the critic of the Reformer. He by
and by returned the copy of the ‘Institutions,’ copiously
annotated on the margins, not only in no terms
of assent, but generally with the unhappy freedom of
expression in which he habitually indulged, and so
little complimentary to the author himself, as it seems,
that Calvin, in writing to a friend and in language not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
over-savoury, says:&mdash;‘There is hardly a page that is
not defiled by his vomit.’ The liberties taken with
the ‘Institutions,’ we may well imagine, were looked
on as a crowning personal insult by Calvin; and, reading
the nature of the man as we do, they may have
been that, super-added to the letters, which put such
rancour into his soul as made him think of the life of
his critic, turned by him into his calumniator, as no more
than a fair forfeit for the offence done.</p>

<p>It was at this time precisely, as it appears, that
Calvin wrote that terribly compromising letter to Farel,
so long contested by his apologists, but now admitted
on all hands&mdash;as indeed how could it be longer denied,
seeing that it is still in existence?&mdash;in which he says:
‘Servetus wrote to me lately, and beside his letter sent
me a great volume full of his ravings, telling me with
audacious arrogance that I should there find things
stupendous and unheard of until now. He offers to
come hither if I approve; but I will not pledge my
faith to him; for did he come, if I have any authority
here, I should never suffer him to go away alive.’<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></p>

<p>Nor is this the only letter written at this time by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
Calvin which shows with what despite he regarded
Servetus. Jerome Bolsec, a quondam monk, now a
physician, opposed to the Papacy and but little less
hostilely inclined to Calvin, speaking of the Reformer’s
persecution of Servetus&mdash;‘an arrogant and insolent man,
forsooth,’&mdash;and of Servetus having addressed a number
of letters to him along with the MS. of a work he
had written, and a copy of the ‘Institutions of the
Christian Religion,’ full of annotations little complimentary
to the author,&mdash;goes on to say: ‘Since which time
Calvin, greatly incensed, conceived a mortal antipathy
to the man, and meditated with himself to have him
put to death. This purpose he proclaimed in a letter
to Pierre Viret of Lausanne, dated the Ides of February
(1546). Among other things in this letter, he
says: “Servetus desires to come hither, on my invitation;
but I will not plight my faith to him; for I have
determined, did he come, that I would never suffer him
to go away alive.” This letter of Calvin fell into my
hands by the providence of God, and I showed it to
many worthy persons&mdash;I know, indeed, where it is still
to be found.’ Bolsec says further that Calvin wrote
to Cardinal Tournon denouncing Servetus of heresy,
some time before making use of William Trie in the
same view to the authorities of Lyons and Vienne, and
that the Cardinal laughed heartily at the idea of one
heretic accusing another. ‘This letter of Calvin to
Cardinal Tournon,’ says Bolsec in continuation, ‘was
shown to me by M. du Gabre, the Cardinal’s secretary.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
William Trie also wrote several letters to Lyons and
Vienne at the instigation of Calvin, which led to the
arrest of Servetus; but he escaped from prison.’</p>

<p>These statements of Bolsec, like the letter to Farel,
have been called in question and their truth denied
by Calvin’s apologists; but they tally in every respect
with what else we know, and explain some things that
would have remained obscure without them. If Calvin
wrote to Farel in the terms he certainly did, we have
no difficulty in believing that he addressed his <i>alter
ego</i>, Viret, in the same way. What is said of the letter
to Cardinal Tournon, also, has every appearance of
truth. The Cardinal took no notice of the heresy proclaimed
from such a quarter as Geneva; or if he hinted
at the matter to his friend the Archbishop of Vienne,
Paumier’s good report of Doctor Villeneuve put a stop
to further inquiry.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></p>

<p>More has probably been made of the letter to
Farel, by the enemies of Calvin, than is altogether
fair. Grotius, who was the first to notice it, says: ‘It
shows that Antichrist had not appeared by Tiber only,
but by Lake Leman also.’ When Calvin wrote to
Farel, however, he did not contemplate the likelihood
of Servetus ever falling into his hands. Neither, indeed,
though grievously offending, had the Spaniard yet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
shown himself utterly incorrigible, a lost creature, fore-ordained
of God, as it seemed, to perdition. At the
time Calvin wrote the letter of February, 1546, to
Farel</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">His murder yet was but fantastical,<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>It was at a later period, when the guilt as he held it
of the man he persistently regarded as the enemy of
God and all religion as well as of himself, was full-blown,
and the ‘Christianismi Restitutio’ appeared in
print, that the threat of bygone years took the shape
of present stern resolve.</p>

<p>Had we but Calvin’s letter to Villeneuve, ‘written
more sharply than was his wont,’ we should, beyond
question, find matter little calculated to flatter the
somewhat presumptuous self-confident man, and may
be fully as certain that the terms in which any future
missive was couched, were not more soothing or conciliatory.
But Servetus had come to look on himself
as commissioned in some sort by God to proclaim a
purer form of Christianity to the world; and any assumption
of superiority on the part of Calvin, was met
by a four-fold show of independence from himself.
Yet does Servetus, once embarked in the correspondence,
satisfy us that he had fallen under the spell of
the great Reformer; fascinated as it seems by him
and, far from being repelled by either his coldness or
his harshness, finding it impossible to forbear making
ever new attempts upon his patience for recognition,
were it even of a little complimentary kind.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span></p>

<p>The ‘great volume full of ravings,’ spoken of in the
letter to Farel, must have been a MS. copy of the ‘Christianismi
Restitutio,’ already written, but not perhaps
finally revised. Upon this work it does not appear
that Calvin ever condescended to offer any strictures;
although it was doubtless accompanied by a letter&mdash;not
printed among the thirty&mdash;requesting an opinion on
its merits. But even as he never had anything of
the kind, neither, although repeatedly asked for, both
directly and through others, as we learn, could Servetus
ever get back his manuscript. Whether retained
in mere contempt, or as evidence against the writer,
with occasion presenting, as has been surmised, we do
not know; but certain it is that Calvin remained persistently
deaf to all the writer’s entreaties to have his
work returned to him. If not purposely retained in
view of the contingency hinted at, it was eventually
used in such wise; for it was among the Documents
furnished by Calvin through Trie to the authorities
of Vienne with the immediate effect of bringing about
the arrest of its writer and imperilling his life.</p>

<p>Turn we to the letters to Calvin, less in view of
their theological import&mdash;the point from which alone
they have hitherto been regarded by the biographers
of Servetus&mdash;than as calculated to let us into the secret
of the misunderstanding and enmity that took such
entire possession of the mind of the Genevese Reformer.
In Servetus’s style of address, as we have
said, we at once note an entire absence of the obsequiousness
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
to which Calvin was accustomed. Far from
approaching the Reformer as a Gamaliel at whose
feet he was to kneel and take lessons, Servetus
assumes the part, not merely of the equal, but often
of the superior, and is by no means nice in the terms
in which he challenges the points he holds erroneous
in the doctrines of the great man he is addressing. In
the very first of the thirty epistles he wrote, whilst
stating an opinion which he knew Calvin must think
heretical or even blasphemous, he ‘desires him to remember&mdash;<i>memineris
qu&aelig;so</i>, &amp;c.&mdash;that the Man, Jesus Christ,
was truly begotten of the substance of God;’ and in
the second of the series informs him quite bluntly that
he is mistaken in his interpretation of Paul’s Epistle
to the Romans. He even attempts to fix him on the
horns of a dilemma by showing that Calvin’s view, if
accepted, would lead to the assumption not of one
Son of God, but of three Sons of God. ‘But all such
tritheistic notions,’ he continues, ‘are illusions of Satan,
and they who acknowledge the Trinity of the Beast
(i.e. of Papal Christianity) are possessed by three
spirits of demons. False are all the invisible Gods of
the Trinitarians, as false as the gods of the Babylonians.
Farewell!’ This at the outset is certainly
not very respectful from the physician of Vienne to
the Spiritual Dictator of Geneva!</p>

<p>The third epistle commences in the same easy
style: ‘<i>S&aelig;pius te monui</i>&mdash;I have repeatedly admonished
you.’ It is on the way in which he imagines
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
Christ to have been engendered by God, and so to be
truly and naturally His Son; adding that he has
always taught the eternity of the Divine Reason,
styled The Word, as prefiguring Christ, in whose face
at the Incarnation, he says, Man first verily saw the
face of God. ‘You are offended with me,’ he proceeds,
‘for speaking as I do of the human form of Christ; but
have patience and I shall lead you up to my conclusion&mdash;<i>te
manducam</i>,’ etc. Fancy John Calvin feeling
himself taken in hand by Michael Servetus!</p>

<p>The fourth, sixth, and seventh epistles are remarkable
for their pantheistic views. ‘God,’ says Servetus,
‘is only known through manifestation, or communication,
in one shape or another. In Creation God
opened the gates of His Treasury of Eternity,’ says
he very grandly. ‘Containing the Essence of the
Universe in Himself, God is everywhere, and in every
thing, and in such wise that he shows himself to us as
fire, as a flower, as a stone.’ Existence, in a word, of
every kind is in, and of, God, and in itself is always
good; it is act or direction that at any time is bad.
But evil as well as good he thinks is also comprised in
the essence of God. This is indicated, he conceives,
by the Hebrew word, ‘π’ (ihei); and he illustrates his
position by the text: ‘I form light and create darkness.’
All accidents, further, are in God; whatever
befals is not apart from God. Without beginning and
without end, God is always becoming&mdash;<i>Semper est Deus
in fieri</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span></p>

<p>In the eighth and ninth letters he informs Calvin
that he ‘would have him know how the <i>Logos</i> and
<i>Sapientia</i>, the Divine Word, the Divine Reason, were
to be understood, in order that he should not go on
abusing these sacred words;’ and it is here that we
meet with various expressions which only acquire significance
when the pantheistic ideas with which he is
full are borne in mind. Here, too, we find the reason
why he would not concede that Calvin and the Reformers
held the true belief in Christ as the Son of God:&mdash;<i>Ille
est vere filius Dei quem in muliere genuit Deus, non ille
quem tu somniasti!</i> Neither did the Reformers, in
his eyes, rightly apprehend <span class="smcap">Justification</span>, which, according
to him, only comes through belief in the Sonship
of Christ as he conceives it.</p>

<p>In the eleventh epistle he says he thinks it will be
labour well spent if he exposes the error into which
his correspondent falls in his interpretation of the
Doctrine of James. Calvin and his sect, we know, set
little store by works of charity and mercy. ‘All that
men do,’ proceeds our letter-writer, ‘you say is done
in sin and is mixed with dregs that stink before God,
and merit nothing but eternal death. But therein you
blaspheme. Stripping us of all possible goodness you
do violence to the teaching of Christ and his Apostles,
who ascribe perfection or the power of being perfect to
us: “Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father in
heaven is perfect.” (Matt. v. 48.) You scout this celestial
perfection because you have never tasted perfection of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
the kind yourself. In the works of the Saintly, I say,
there is nothing of the corruption you feign. The works
of the Spirit shine before God and before men, and in
themselves are good and proper. Thou reprobate and
blasphemer, who calumniatest the works of the Spirit&mdash;<i>Tu
improbus et blasphemus qui opera Spiritus calumniaris!</i>’</p>

<p>Can we wonder at Calvin’s rage with the man
who dared to address him in such language as this?
On his trial at Geneva Servetus tells his judges that
the correspondence between him and the Reformer
degenerated by degrees on both sides into mutual recrimination
and abuse. In the above objectionable
passage we see, if not the beginning, yet a significant
sample of this unhappy style, which continues even to
the end. Had we Calvin’s letters, we should certainly
find them not more guarded in expression&mdash;for Calvin
was a master of invective, with a superabundant vocabulary
of epithets at command, and never choice in
the use of those he applied to opponents&mdash;rascal, dog,
ass, and swine being found of constant occurrence
among them&mdash;had there been any stronger than scoundrel
and blasphemer, they would assuredly have been
hurled at Servetus.</p>

<p>Referring to the subject of Justification, Calvin, as
we presume, must have said, in one of his letters, that
Justification is <i>imputed</i> by God, and that no change
takes place in him who is justified. To this Servetus,
in his thirteenth epistle, exclaims: ‘What do I hear?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
The spirit of man suffers no change through sin! But
if sin cause change, then must there also be change
when sin is taken away. He, forsooth, who sits in
darkness differs in nothing from him who sits in light!
Your justification is Satanic merely if the conscience
within you remains as it was before, and your new life
of faith differs in nothing from the old death. God
grant, O Calvin, that, ridding you of your magical
fascinations, you may abound to overflowing in all
good things; but Peter’s disputation against Simon
Magus refutes you, teaching, as it does, the excellence
of works even in the heathen. The justification you
preach, therefore, is mere magical fascination and
folly.’</p>

<p>In another of his letters Calvin must have asked
Servetus where the Apostle John teaches that we in
this world are such as was Christ? Which his correspondent
answers by referring him to the fourth
chapter of the Epistle general, where he would find
these words: ‘Because as he is, so are we in this
world.’ We can fancy how vexed Calvin must have
been with himself for the slip he had made, as well
as angry with the triumph of his opponent, who continues:
‘But you neither rightly understand Faith in
Christ, nor good works, nor the Celestial Kingdom.
In the New Covenant a new and living way was
inaugurated; but you, true Jew&mdash;<i>tu vero Judaico</i>&mdash;would
shame me by a show of zeal and whelm
me with contumely because I say with Christ, “He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
who is least shall in this Kingdom be greater than
Abraham.”’</p>

<p>If Calvin neither understands the nature of Faith,
nor of Justification, we shall not wonder when we find
that no more is he credited with comprehending Regeneration,
‘You have not understood true Regeneration,
nor the Celestial Kingdom, whereof Faith is the
gate. Regeneration, I maintain, comes through baptism;
you say that Christ thought nothing of the water. But
is it not written that we are born anew by water? and
is it not of water that Paul speaks when he designates
baptism the Laver of Regeneration, saying, “We are
cleansed from sin by washing with water?” Men, you
say, are regenerate when they are enlightened; you
must therefore concede that they who are baptized in
their infancy, being without understanding and so unenlightened,
cannot be regenerated. Yet do you
contend that they are properly baptized. Dissevering
regeneration from baptism you make baptism a sign of
adoption; but you deceive yourself in this, the Scriptures
declaring that adoption is effected when to the
believer is given the spirit of the divine Sonship&mdash;πνεύμα
Ὑωοθεσίος. On your own showing, then, infants, being
unregenerate, can enter the Kingdom of Heaven
neither by faith nor by hope; and thou, thief and
robber&mdash;<i>tu Fur et Latro</i>(!)&mdash;keepest them from the
gate. As a prelude to Baptism Peter required repentance.
Let your infants repent, then; and do you
yourself repent and come to baptism, having true faith
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
in Jesus Christ&mdash;<i>pœniteat te igitur, et vere Jesu Christi
fide ad baptismum accede</i>&mdash;to the end that you may
receive the gift of the Holy Spirit promised therein.
But you satisfy yourself with illusions, and say that the
infants who die [unbaptized?] were predestined, impudently
misusing sacred speech as is your wont; for in
the Scriptures predestination is not spoken of save in
connection with belief and believers. God, I say, sees
no one justified from eternity unless he believes.’ Let
us think of Calvin, spiritual dictator to one half of reformed
Christendom, schooled in this style by the poor
body-curer of Vienne! called thief and robber to his
face, and all the more irate with his teacher from
feeling, as we fancy he must have felt, that he had not
always the best of the argument. Servetus’s dialectic
is at least a match for his own.</p>

<p>But our restorer of Christianity has not yet done
with his p&aelig;do-baptism: the subject is continued in the
next letter, which closes with a prayer in the very
finest spirit of piety, but to Calvin may possibly have
seemed profane, he having made up his mind that
Servetus was not only without religion himself, but bent
on effacing religion from the heart of man. Here is
the prayer:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘O thou, most merciful Jesus, who with such signs
of love and blessing didst take the little ones into thine
arms, bless them now and ever, and with Thy guiding
hand so lead them that in faith they may become partakers
of Thy Heavenly Kingdom. Amen!’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span></p>

<p>Calvin, we believe, treats the ‘Descent into Hell’
as legendary. Servetus thinks the Hebrew word
<i>Scheol</i> signifies the <i>grave</i> as well as the traditional <i>hell</i>,
and seems to make it a kind of resting-place for the
unregenerate until the resurrection. Adam, he says,
by his transgression fell both soul and body into the
power of the Serpent. But where can the soul of him
be after death who is the slave of such a master? Are
not the gates of Paradise closed against him?&mdash;is not
the whole man given over to the power of the mighty
tyrant? ‘Who shall set him free? No one, assuredly,
but Christ’&mdash;and so on, in terms entirely unobjectionable,
and in complete conformity with accredited
opinion; but tending, we imagine, to what is called
<i>Universalism</i>, Servetus believing, as we read him,
that all men would be saved in the end, though ordinary
sinners would have to wait until the day of Judgment.
He nowhere speaks of any lake of burning brimstone,
fanned by the Devil, in which the wicked are tortured
throughout eternity. Annihilation, with him, is the
penalty of unpardonable sin.</p>

<p>The Twentieth Epistle is especially interesting as
showing us the very heart of the writer; letting us into
his secret, as it were, and showing us the ideas that led
him to his scheme of restoring the lapsed faith of mankind
in Christ as the naturally begotten Son of God,
and of reconstituting his Church, long vanished from
the face of the earth. The true Church, however, is
not to be thought of as an institution made by man,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
but as a foundation originated by Christ. And the
question as to where this true Church exists, is not
difficult of determination if the authority of the Scriptures
be admitted as paramount in matters of belief.
But the authority of the Scriptures, and of the true
Church represented by those purified by the water of
baptism and governed by the Holy Spirit, he says, is
equal ‘<i>The true Church of Christ, indeed, is independent
of the Scriptures. There was a Church of
Christ before there was any writing of the Apostles.</i>
But where is now the Church? Ever present in
celestial spirits and the souls of the blest, it fled from
earth as many as 1260 years ago. It is in heaven, and
typified by the woman adorned with the sun and the
twelve stars (Revelation). Invisible among us now, it
will again be seen before long. We with ours, the congregation
of Christ, will be the Church. Towards the
restoration of this Church it is that I labour incessantly;
and it is because I mix myself up with that battle of
Michael and the Angels, and seek to have all the pious
on my side, that you are displeased with me. As the
good angels did battle in heaven against the Dragon,
so do other angels now contend against the Papacy on
earth. Do you not believe that the angels will prevail?
But as the Dragon could not, so neither can the Papacy,
be worsted without the angels. The celestial regeneration
by baptism it is that makes us equals of the
angels in our war with spiritual iniquity. See you not,
then, that the question is the restoration of the Church
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
driven from among us? The words of John show us
that a battle was in prospect: seduction was to precede,
the battle was to follow; and the time is now at hand.
Who, think you, are they who shall gain the victory
over the Beast? They, assuredly, who have not
received his mark. Grant, O God, to thy soldier
that with thy might he may manfully bear him
against the Dragon, who gave such power to the
Beast. Amen!’</p>

<p>In the above we have the whole mystical being of
the man laid bare before us, and the nature of the
cause in which he was engaged made known. Servetus
certainly believed that he was an instrument in
the hand of God for proclaiming a better saving faith
to the world. It was by a certain Divine impulse, he
says himself, that he was led to his subject, and woe to
him did he not evangelise! He seems even to have
thought that he had his vocation shadowed out to him
in his name. The angel Michael led the embattled
hosts of heaven to war against the Dragon; and he,
Michael Servetus, had been chosen to lead the angels
on earth against Antichrist! The Roman interpretation
of Christianity, with its Pope and hierarchy, its assumed
sovereignty, its pompous ceremonial and ritualistic
apparatus, had failed to make the world either
wiser or better; the entire system was rotten to the
core; hence the revolt of such scholarly monks as
Erasmus and Luther, and of such learned priests as
Zwingli, Calvin, Melanchthon, Bullinger, Bucer, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
rest. But they, too, still showed more or less of the
‘mark of the Beast.’ They had rid themselves of the
Mass and Transubstantiation, of compromises for sin
by payments in money, of monkeries, nunneries, the
invocation of saints, prayers to the Virgin, and so on;
but they had retained much that was objectionable&mdash;particularly
a Trinity of persons in the Godhead
(tantamount, said Servetus, to the recognition of three
Gods instead of one God), and infant baptism.</p>

<p>By their strenuous insistance on the effects of
Adam’s transgression as compromising mankind at
large, and Abraham’s readiness to sacrifice his only son,
they had moreover interspersed the religion of Christ
with such an amount of Judaism that their Christianity
was in many respects a relapse into the bonds of the
Law, from which Christ had set us free. A reformation
of the Church had been commenced, therefore, but was
by no means completed; much still remained to be
done; the world was waiting, in fact, for a better interpretation
of Christ’s life and doctrine as contained
in the Gospels, and this the studies and meditations
of Michael Servetus, he believed, qualified him in
no mean measure to supply. Hence the books on
Trinitarian Error and the Restoration of Christianity;
and hence, also, the hostility of Calvin and his followers,
who were minded that they had already reformed and
restored, and verily represented, or were in fact, the
true Church.</p>

<p>Like the leaders of other bands of enthusiasts of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
which the world has seen so many, Servetus, relying
on the New Testament record, thought that the day
was at hand when Christ should appear in the clouds
to judge the world and consummate all things. He
overlooked the fact that Paul, whom he resembled in
so many respects, had had the same fancy fifteen hundred
years before him, and that matters had nevertheless
gone on much as they had always done, without
the day of judgment having dawned. Calvin with his
educated understanding and his experience of the
world, ought to have seen Servetus as the pious enthusiast
he was in fact, and not as the enemy of God and
Religion, as well as of himself. Failing to cure him of
his extravagant fancies, he might safely have left him
to indulge them, as being little likely to compromise
his own or any other system of Christianity, the Papacy
perhaps excepted, to which the would-be Restorer was
truly much more violently opposed than the Reformer.
But hate had blinded Calvin; considerations personal
to himself had complicated and in some sort superseded
such as were associated with religion.</p>

<p>On the subject of Faith, to which Calvin’s system
gave much less free play than Luther’s, we find Servetus
siding with him of the North rather than him
of the South. Neither of them, however, as we have
seen, had any conception of faith in the way Servetus
understood it. Faith, says he, consists in a certain
compliant state of mind, proclaimed by unquestioning
assent. This, the true saving faith, is of the kind
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
avowed by Peter when he declared Jesus to be the
Christ, the Son of the living God. Yet faith even
of this kind, distinctly as it has the lead in Servetus’s
Christology, is not yet all in all: to become efficient or
saving, it must be conjoined with Charity. ‘If faith be
not clothed with charity,’ says he, ‘it dies in nakedness;
and as habit is strengthened by action, the body by
exercise, and the understanding by study, so is faith
strengthened by good works.’ The subject-will and
fatalism, asserted by Calvin in his doctrine of predestination
and election, have therefore no real foundation
in Scripture; nay more, there is unreason in the assumption
of such a principle, and in the admonition
given to mankind to do that which it must be known
beforehand they cannot do. ‘You speak,’ says our
writer, ‘of free acts, yet really say that there is no such
thing as free action. But who so devoid of understanding
as to prescribe free choice to one incapable of
choosing freely! It is mere fatuity besides to derive
subject-will from this: that it is God who acts in us.
Truly God does act in us; but in such wise that we
act freely. He acts in us so that we understand and
will, choose, determine, and pursue. Even as all things
consist essentially in God, so do all things proceed essentially
from him. The Spirit of God is innate in
man, and as the power to do is one thing, so is the
necessity to do another. Although God elects us as
the potter does his clay, it by no means follows that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
we are nothing more than clay. Paul’s simile deceives
you; it is not universally applicable.’</p>

<p>The Law of Moses, Calvin has said, is still in force
and to be observed by us as truly as it was by the
Jews; violating it, he says, we violate the Law of God.
Servetus’s reply to this is the burden of the Twenty-third
and three following Letters. ‘I fancy I hear
some Jew or Mussulman speaking here,’ says our respondent.
‘But to what is violence done&mdash;is it to a
stone, or to certain letters cut in a stone? Christ, I
say, accomplished the Law and then it was abrogated;
in him we have the New Covenant, the Old superseded;
in him are we made free. The law of Moses
was unbearable; it slew the soul, it increased sin, it
begat anger; virtue itself through it became at times
transgression, and in compassion for our frailty it was
annulled. You make God exercise a rude and miserable
people in a mill-round. What would you say
were some tyrant to require mountains of gold or the
stars of heaven from your Genevese, and threaten
them with death for non-compliance with his demands?
But the Old Law bound men to impossibilities. Art
thou not then ashamed of slavery and tyrannical violence?
Insisting on the observance of this law, you
yet go on dreaming with your Luther, and saying that
no one ever entirely fulfilled the commandment which
says “thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole
heart and soul.” David and others, then, who said that
they sought God with all their heart and strove with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
all their might to keep his commandments, are but
liars to you. <i>And what, after all, are the laws of
Moses? If conformable to Nature then are they the
laws of God, the author of Nature, older than Moses,
and to be observed of Christians independently of Moses.</i>
But God never required obedience of the kind you
imagined; he but asks of each according to his strength.
Cease then, O Calvin, to torture us with the law of
Moses, and to insist on its observance. It looks as
if you had a mind to be pitied of God in your impotency&mdash;of
God who may be said so often to have had
to take pity on the Jews when they were under the
law.’ Who shall say that Michael Servetus was not
in advance of John Calvin?</p>

<p>The twenty-seventh, eighth, and ninth epistles are
only significant as expositions of doctrinal views in
their bearing on social life. Is it lawful, he asks, for a
Christian to assume the magistracy? to administer the
laws of the land and to take the lives of evil-doers?
Of course it is. The order of the world is maintained
by law and justice. But then to take life? Where
there is hope of amendment, as in the case of the
woman taken in adultery, we see the penalty of death
remitted: Go, said Jesus to her, and sin no more.
But even where there is malice and unyielding obstinacy,
recourse is to be had to chastisement of other
kinds than taking life. Among these, banishment, approved
by Christ, and excommunication, practised by
the Church, are to be commended. Schism and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
heresy were punished in this way whilst traces of
apostolic tradition remained. Criminals, in matters
not pertaining to the faith, are variously punished by
the laws of every country; and this is in conformity
with natural law. They bear the sword aright and
lawfully who bear it in the cause of justice and to the
repression of crime; and it is not against gospel precepts
that we serve as soldiers in defence of our lives
and possessions.</p>

<p>Servetus, we find, accords rather extensive powers
to Bishops, whom, in opposition to Calvin, he recognises,
and to Ministers of the Church generally.
Bishops, like good shepherds, are to know their flocks,
and to take care that no infection gets in among them;
ministers again&mdash;he does not use the word priests&mdash;are
privileged to reconcile sinners to God, and to punish
unbelievers by excommunicating them and delivering
them over to Satan and spiritual death. Their
authority, however, is only to be exercised under the
guidance of the Spirit&mdash;what spirit he does not say.
Confession, too, he approves of, but the minister is
not to be consulted save in case of some grave doubt
or difficulty arising.</p>

<p>Our writer is greatly displeased with Calvin’s interpretation
of the parable of the labourers in the vineyard,
in which like wages are given to those hired at
every hour of the day; from which the Reformer infers
that there is no difference or distinction in glory, in
faith, or in works. ‘To you truly,’ says Servetus,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
‘there needs no distinction as to less or more; for
with you these are all alike of non-avail, some as you
maintain being saved with, as some are saved without,
merit of their own. But it is faith that of the impious
makes the pious, of the dead the living. Ignorant of
all gospel truth is he who does not attach supreme
significance to faith in Christ as the Son of God.’</p>

<p>The concluding epistle of the series must have
given great offence to Calvin, the writer reproaching
him with setting the Christian on no higher level
than the vulgar Jew. ‘They are alike to you, indeed,
alike carnal, because to you are the benefits of Christ’s
coming unknown; to you who in the Supper partake
of nothing more than a trope or figure, and who treat
baptism as the equivalent of a Levitical rite, the sign
of a thing that is not. But in the Supper we, nourished
by immortal food, for a terrestrial have a new celestial
life imparted to us, and how should he perish who has
once partaken of Christ? May God give you to receive
all these things with a true understanding, led
by the spirit of truth, by Jesus Christ and the Father.
Amen.’ Scouting the Roman Catholic dogma of
transubstantiation, as he did, we here find Servetus
speaking as if he believed that it was the body of
Christ indeed that was partaken of in the Supper! To
understand this in him his pantheistic notions must
again be taken into account. But pantheism, when not
detached from the idea of <i>personality</i>, in the usual acceptation
of the word, leads inevitably to such absurdity.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
Speaking as he does now, Servetus forgets his philosophy
and yields himself up to his mysticism. With
as much justice might he have said that Cannibals
partake of God when they eat one another, as that the
Christian communicant partakes of Christ when he
joins the simple, solemn, commemorative feast.

<p class="hang">‘CHRISTIANISMI RESTITUTIO’&mdash;THE RESTORATION OF
CHRISTIANITY&mdash;DISCOVERY OF THE PULMONARY CIRCULATION.</p>

<p>We have seen that Servetus could never recover his
MS. of the Restoration of Christianity from the hands
of Calvin. But he had not sent his work for the review
of the Reformer without retaining a copy for himself,
and this he determined now to have printed and sent
abroad into the world. With this view he forwarded
the Manuscript to a publisher of Basle, Marrinus by
name, with whom&mdash;if we may infer so much from the
address of the publisher’s letter to him declining the
work&mdash;he must have been on terms of intimacy. Marrinus’s
letter is short, to the point, and in the following
terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Gratia et pax a Deo, Michael carissime!&mdash;the grace
and peace of God be with you, dearest Michael! I
have received your letter and your book; but I fancy
that on reflection you will see why it cannot be published
at Basle at this present time. When I have
perused it [more carefully] I shall therefore return it
to you by the accredited messenger you may send for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
it. But I beg you not to question my friendly feelings
towards you. To what you say besides I shall reply
at greater length and more particularly on another
occasion. Farewell! Thy</p>

<p>
<span class="author smcap">Marrinus.</span><br />
‘Basle, April 9, 1552.’</p>

<p>The MS., even on a cursory perusal, had evidently
frightened the worthy publisher of Basle: he would
have nothing to do with it; but this did not put our
author from his purpose of publication. Not going so
far afield as Basle, he took Balthasar Arnoullet, bookseller
and publisher, and William Geroult, manager of
his printing establishment, both of Vienne, into his
confidence, giving them to understand that though the
book he wished to have printed was against the doctrines
of Luther, Calvin, Melanchthon, and other heretics,
there were many reasons why neither his name as the
author, nor Vienne as the place of publication, should
appear on the title-page.</p>

<p>Arnoullet, like Marrinus, must have had misgivings
about the reception the book was likely to meet with
from the clergy of France, and, aware of the danger he
incurred who printed and published aught out of conformity
with the doctrines of the holy Roman Catholic and
Apostolic Church, he too must have declined in the first
instance to undertake the work. But Michel Villeneuve
had been prosperous; he had money in his purse, and
engaging not only to take the whole of the expenses on
himself, but to add a gratuity of 100 crowns to the cost,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
Arnoullet consented at last to run the risk of publication,
meaning, however, that the world at large should know
nothing of him as instrumental in the business. No
one then knew that Secerius of Hagenau had printed
the ‘De Trinitatis Erroribus,’ or that its author, Michael
Servetus, was Doctor Villeneuve. Why should it ever
transpire that Balthasar Arnoullet of Vienne had
printed the ‘Restitutio Christianismi,’ or that Monsieur
Michel Villeneuve the physician was its writer? To
keep the secret within their own circle, therefore, the
work must not be composed in the usual place of
business, and none but the most indispensable hands
be employed upon it. A small house, away from the
known printing establishment, was accordingly taken;
type cases and a press were there set up, and the work
once entered on proceeded regularly without interruption
during a period of between three and four months,
when the impression, consisting of 1,000 copies, was
successfully worked off.</p>

<p>Arnoullet, although we shall by and by find him
declaring his entire ignorance of the burden of the
book, and charging his manager, Geroult, with having
deceived him on this head and by misrepresentations
induced him to meddle with the publication at all, must
nevertheless have been well aware of its nature. The
measures taken to keep the outside world in ignorance
of what was going on, the arrangement with the author
to be his own reader for press, and the premium paid,
give the lie to all his asseverations. Servetus, too,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
in his determination to keep his name from the title-page,
and leave this blank of the place of publication,
shows that neither was he blind to the danger that
waited on the production of such a book as the Restoration
of Christianity in Roman Catholic France. The
printing press, though eagerly welcomed on all hands
at first, soon fell out of favour with the Church of
Rome, and so continues with that conspiracy against
the rights, the liberties, and the progress of mankind.
But Michael Servetus was too vain, too thoroughly
persuaded of his own apostolic mission to the world, to
leave his book, the crowning labour of his life, without
some sufficient mark of its paternity. On the last page,
accordingly, we find the initials of his name and designation
in capital letters, thus, M.S.V., immediately over
the date MDLIII., the year of the intended publication.
But even so much was not wanted to proclaim
the author. Innocently or inadvertently he says in his
Preface that he had formerly treated briefly of the
subjects he is now about to discuss at greater length;
and in the body of the work he may even be said to
make his appearance in person, and in his proper
name; for we there have Michael and Peter as interlocutors,
precisely as in the old ‘Dialogi ij de Trinitate’
of the year 1532.</p>

<p>Printed with every precaution to secure secrecy,
with nothing intentionally about it to lead the uninitiated
to suspect what was meant by the M.S.V. at the
end, or a hint, even had it been divined that Michael
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
Servetus Villanovanus was thereby indicated, to show
that he and Michel Villeneuve of Vienne were one and
the same personage, it is obvious that the ‘Christianismi
Restitutio’ was not intended for publication or sale either
in Vienne or France&mdash;probably not even in Basle or
Geneva, in the first instance. Villeneuve would keep
the place where he lived, and the country that sheltered
him, as well as the nearest neighbouring land, out of the
storm which he plainly foresaw would be raised by his
daring innovations on accredited Christian doctrine, and
his more than Luther-like denunciations of the Papacy.
The whole impression was therefore made up into bales
of 100 copies in each, of which five were confided to
the safe keeping of Pierre Merrin, typefounder of
Lyons&mdash;a brother in all likelihood of the Marrinus of
Basle, with whose name we are already acquainted&mdash;in
view of their being forwarded by water to Genoa and
Venice. A bale or two we know were sent by Arnoullet
to his agent at Frankfort; and as Frelon was
now in the secret of Servetus, we can hardly doubt of
his having taken some share in the venture and despatched
at least a bale to the same great emporium of
the book trade. It must have been from Frelon, indeed,
that Calvin by and by obtained the couple of copies of
the ‘Restitutio’ he required for the purposes of the prosecution
he had instituted against its author; and it is
almost certainly to him, not to Robert Etienne, the
bookseller of Geneva, as has been said, that Calvin
refers in his letter to the Frankfort Clergy ‘as a well-disposed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
person who will put no obstacle in the way of
the seizure and destruction of the obnoxious book which
he has learned had been sent for exposition and sale
among them.’ The remainder of the impression&mdash;and
there could now have been little of it left on hand&mdash;for
safe stowage away from the Archiepiscopal city of
Vienne, was confided by Arnoullet to the custody of a
friend, Bertet by name, resident at Chatillon.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span></p>

<p>The book on the ‘Restoration of Christianity,’<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> often
spoken of, though so rare as seldom to be seen, comprises
a series of disquisitions on the speculative and
practical principles of Christianity, as apprehended by
the author; thirty letters to John Calvin; a disquisition
on as many as sixty signs of the reign of Antichrist,
and an apologetic address to Philip Melanchthon and
his followers.</p>

<p>‘The task we have set ourselves here,’ says the
Author in his Preface or Introduction, ‘is truly sublime;
for it is no less than to make God known in his
substantial manifestation by The Word and his divine
communication by the Spirit, both comprised in Christ,
through whom alone do we learn how the divineness
of the Word and the Spirit may be apprehended in
Man. Hidden from human sight in former times,
God is now both manifested and communicated to the
world, manifestation taking place by the Word, communication
by the Spirit, to the end that we may see
him face to face as it were in Creation, and feel him
intuitively but lucidly declared in ourselves. It is
high time that the door leading to knowledge of this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
kind were opened; for otherwise no one can either
know God truly, read the Scriptures aright, or be a
Christian.’</p>

<p>How much the writer is in earnest is farther proclaimed
by the Invocation to Christ and the Address
to the Reader with which he concludes his Introduction:
‘O Christ Jesus, Son of God, Thou Who wast given
to us from heaven, Thou Who in Thyself makest
Deity visibly manifest, I, Thy servant, now proclaim
Thee, that so great a manifestation may be made
known to all. Grant then to Thy petitioner Thy good
Spirit and Thy effectual Speech; guide Thou his mind
and his pen that he may worthily declare the glory of
Thy Divinity, and give pious utterance to the true
faith concerning Thee. The cause indeed is Thine,
for by a certain Divine impulse it is that I am led to
speak of Thy Glory from the Father. In former
days did I begin to treat of this, and again do I enter
upon it; for now am I to be made known to all the
pious; now truly are the days complete, as appears
from the certainty of the thing itself and the visible
signs of the times. The Light Thou hast said is not
to be hidden; so woe to me do I not evangelise!</p>

<p>‘It rests with thee, then, O Reader, that thou show
thyself well disposed towards Christ, even to the End,
and that thou hear our subject discussed at length in
words of truth without disguise.’</p>

<p>After a somewhat careful perusal of the ‘Christianismi
Restitutio,’ we know not how it could be better
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
or more briefly characterised, in its theoretical portion
at least, than as a paraphrase and new interpretation of
the Gospel according to John, in which the Neo-platonic
doctrine of the Logos is particularly discussed,
and copiously interfused with pantheistic ideas, whilst
the dogmatic teaching of the Church of Rome and its
practical application is repudiated <i>in toto</i>, and the
chief doctrines of Lutheran and Calvinistic Christianity
are controverted.</p>

<p>Assuming the leading positions of the writer as
guides, we should say that in his philosophy he regards
the world as a manifestation and communication of
God in time and space, manifestation taking place, as
he says, through the Word, communication through
the agency called Spirit. The first of things in which
God showed Himself, he says, was Light, which he
speaks of as uncreated&mdash;<i>lux increata</i>, essence or first
principle of things&mdash;all existence, all generation being
effected by the energising power of light. In, and of,
and first manifested by light, God, however, is not
identified therewith, any more than with the things of
creation, in all of which he is still held to be immanent.
God indeed in himself is supersensuous and incomprehensible,
for he transcends all things&mdash;mind as well as
matter. When not sought to be defined by negatives,
God is to be thought of as Absolute Being, and all
existence, as deriving from him, is to be accounted
divine, although in diverse degrees.</p>

<p>The manifold manifestations which God makes of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
himself in nature are referred to a single dispensation or
mode, the mode of the Plenitude of Substance, which
comprises all other modes or dispensations in their
endless diversity, patterns or types of all things that be
having been present in the mind of God before they
were in themselves. An architypal universe is therefore
assumed as having existed before the actual world
came into being, and this, says Servetus, is the Logos
of Scripture and Philosophy&mdash;the Divine Reason,
wherein reflected all things showed themselves visibly.
<i>Ea ipsa erat λὀγος erat ratio mirifica in qua omnia
visibiliter relucebat.</i> The Logos&mdash;Divine Word, Divine
Wisdom, God himself, in fact&mdash;it is that is revealed or
manifested in Creation, as in the fulness of time it
also became incarnate in Christ; for, even as before
Creation the world existed ideally in God, so before
the incarnation was Christ potentially present in the
Divine mind as the Divine word, in the same way as
the future plant is extant in the seed. From the beginning,
therefore, it was a virtual or potential Son,
not any actual co-eternal Son, who existed beside the
Father, the Son first acquiring form and substance in
the womb of the Virgin Mary, and being made participant
of the Holy Spirit at the moment of his birth
when he began to breathe; for Servetus assimilated
the abstraction entitled Spirit to breath or wind:
God, say the Scriptures, breathed into the nostrils of
man and he became a living soul.</p>

<p>Possessed, as he was, by the principles of the Neo-platonic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
and other more ancient philosophies, Servetus
assimilates Christ to the Demiurgos, and makes of him
the architect and fashioner of the world&mdash;<i>ille mundi
Architectus Christus</i>&mdash;Creator even of the elements
from which, intermingled, are educed the substantial
forms of things. How this was brought about if Christ
only became a reality at his birth, he does not say.
But it is not a little interesting to note how nearly our
own Great King of transcendental song approaches
some of these fancies of our author, for Milton too
speaks of Light as</p>

<span class="i8">Offspring of heaven firstborn,<br /></span>

<p>A little further on he also has the Son as Agent in

<p>Into what labyrinths are men led when they give the
rein to imagination, and the demon of speculation
divorced from science is suffered to have his uncontrolled
way!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Coming to a more particular analysis of the ‘Restitutio,’
we find the first book treating of the man
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
Jesus, in which he is shown to be, 1st, Man; 2nd, Son
of God; and 3rd, God.</p>

<p>I. The name Jesus [Joshua, Hebraice], says
Servetus, is the name of a man and was given on the
day of the Circumcision; the cognomen Christ [Χρίστος,
Gr&aelig;ce, the anointed], was bestowed by the Disciples,
but never admitted by the Jews, who only knew Jesus
as the son of Joseph. There was indeed frequent discussion
among the disciples themselves, whether Jesus
was the Messiah or not; and we know that kings,
in virtue of the anointing at their coronation, were entitled
Christs&mdash;Cyrus, for instance, is called Masach
by the Prophet, the word Christ being no more than
the Hebrew title translated into Greek.</p>

<p>II. It is as a Son of God,&mdash;υἵος Θεοῦ&mdash;that Jesus
is spoken of in the Scriptures. But if so, then is he
to be thought of as engendered by God as thou by thy
father. God, it is true, is in a certain sense the Father
of all men as he is of Jesus; but we are his sons by
adoption as Jesus is his Son by nature. Jesus, indeed,
was believed to be the son of Joseph, but he was
truly the Son of God, having, without any sophistry,
been engendered of his substance: the Word of God
overshadowed the Virgin like a cloud, and acted in her
as generative dew, comparable to the shower from
heaven that causes the earth to bring forth flowers and
fruit. It follows, therefore, that the son of the Virgin
is also truly, naturally, the Son of God.</p>

<p>III. Christ is God, and is so called because in him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
is God substantially, corporeally present; for he is
God by his geniture as by his flesh he is man
(p. 15), God and man being truly conjoined in one
substance and made one body, one new man. As the
Father is true God, so, in bestowing his divineness
(<i>Deitas</i>) on his only Son, did he cause it to be that
the Son should be true God.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Having spoken of God and Christ, he treats next
of the Trinity. In the beginning, it is said, was the
word, Ὁ λὀγος, an expression whereby inward Reason
and outward Speech are implied. Some, says the
writer, have held that God can be defined no otherwise
than by negations: ears have not heard God speak,
save by the voice of man; hands have not touched
Him, for He is incorporeal; place holds Him not, for
He cannot be circumscribed; and time gives no measure
of Him, for, infinite, He is without beginning and
without end. But all this only speaks of what God is
not; it does not teach what God is. Now, no one
knows God who is ignorant of the mode in which He
has willed to manifest Himself to us, plainly exposed
though it be in the sacred oracles. These, however,
the Sophists do not believe, because they will not see
God in Christ (p. 111). In the Word made flesh, in
the face of Jesus Christ it is that we see the Light&mdash;God
Himself&mdash;shining upon us. In thinking of the engenderment
of Christ, and his appearance on earth, the
veil of any intervening time is to be rejected; Christ
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
being to be conceived of as having been eternally engendered
in the mind of God, but only begotten of his
substance in time in the womb of the Virgin Mary.
The man Christ is therefore, and because of this, fitly
spoken of as the first-born Son of God, begotten before
all worlds (pp. 56, 57), substantially visible before
creation, and possessed of eternal substance&mdash;<i>visibilem
cum</i> (<i>Christum</i>) <i>substantialiter ante omnia fuisse et substantiam
&aelig;ternam habere</i> (p. 57)&mdash;the meaning of which
we imagine to be this: that the idea of Christ, present
in the mind of God from eternity, took form by his
immediate agency in the womb of Mary, the wife of
Joseph, whose son the man Jesus was believed by his
contemporaries to be, though he was indeed the Son
of God.</p>

<p>One of the items of transcendental belief, therefore,
in which Servetus differed wholly from the Reformers,
had reference to the coeternity of the Father and the
Son. On this head he says particularly, ‘If there were
in eternity two incorporeal beings alike and equal,
then were these Twins rather than a Father and Son;
and were a third Entity added, like and equal to the
other two, then were there a threefold Geryon produced.’
These words, and others of corresponding import, were
found highly objectionable or blasphemous by the
Reformers, as we have already had occasion to say.</p>

<p>In connection with this part of his subject the writer
adds several of the comments he had appended to the
Pagnini Bible, particularly the one in which he discusses
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
the verse of Isaiah, beginning: ‘A virgin shall conceive
and bear a son,’ &amp;c., in which he maintains that the
Almah, the marriageable woman mentioned, refers immediately
to Abija, the youthful wife of Ahaz, then
pregnant with Hezekiah.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus far advanced, it is now that we find the pantheistic
conceptions of our author most fully enunciated.
Referring to the words quoted by St. Paul, ‘In God we
live, and move, and have our being,’ Servetus maintains
that God is in all things, and all things are in
God; in his own words, ‘It is God who gives its <small>ESSE</small>
or essential being to every existing thing&mdash;to inanimate
creation, to living creatures in general, and to man in
especial.’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The fifth book treats of the Holy Spirit. ‘As the
essence of God is the Word,’ says our author, ‘in
so far as manifestation is made in the world, so, and
in so far as communication is made, it is Spirit; manifestation
and communication, however, being ever
co-ordinate and conjoined. It is spirit that is the architype,
eternally present in God, from whom it proceeds’
(p. 163). And it is in this place that our author explains
or illustrates some of his metaphysical positions
by a reference to Anatomy, with which in various
interesting particulars he shows himself more satisfactorily
intelligible than in his transcendental speculations.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span></p>

<p>‘There is commonly said to be a threefold spirit
in the body of man, derived from the substance of the
three superior elements&mdash;a natural, a vital, and an
animal spirit; there are, however, not really three, but
only two distinct spirits. One of these, the first, characterised
as <i>natural</i>, is communicated from the arteries
to the veins by their anastomoses, and is primarily
associated with the blood, the proper seat or home of
which is the liver and veins. The second is the <i>vital</i>
spirit, whose seat or dwelling-place is the heart and
arteries. The third, the <i>animal</i> spirit, comparable to
a ray of light, has its home in the brain and nerves.
In each and all of these is the force&mdash;<i>energeia</i>&mdash;of the
one spirit and light of God comprised. Now, that the
natural spirit is imparted from the heart to the liver,
and not from the liver to the heart, is proclaimed by
the formation of man in the womb; for we see an artery
associate with a vein sent from the mother through
the navel of the fœtus; and in the adult body we
always find an artery and a vein conjoined. But it
was truly into the heart of Adam that God breathed
the breath of life or the soul. From the heart, therefore,
it is that life is communicated to the liver; for by
the breathing into the mouth and nostrils it was that
the soul was first truly imparted, the breath tending
directly to the heart.</p>

<p>‘The heart is the first organ that lives, and, situate
in the middle of the body, is the source of its heat.
From the liver the heart receives the liquor, the material
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
as it were of life, and in turn gives life to the
source of the supply. The material of life is therefore
derived from the liver; but, elaborated as you shall
hear, by a most admirable process, it comes to pass
that the life itself is in the blood&mdash;yea that the blood
is the life, as God himself declares (Genes. ix.; Levit.
xvii.; Deut. xii.).</p>

<p>‘Rightly to understand the question here, the first
thing to be considered is the substantial generation of
the vital spirit&mdash;a compound of the inspired air with
the most subtle portion of the blood. The vital spirit
has, therefore, its source in the left ventricle of the
heart, the lungs aiding most essentially in its production.
It is a fine attenuated spirit, elaborated by the
power of heat, of a crimson colour and fiery potency&mdash;the
lucid vapour as it were of the blood, substantially
composed of water, air, and fire; for it is engendered,
as said, by the mingling of the inspired air with the
more subtle portion of the blood which the right
ventricle of the heart communicates to the left. This
communication, however, does not take place through
the septum, partition or midwall of the heart, as commonly
believed, but by another admirable contrivance,
the blood being transmitted from the pulmonary artery
to the pulmonary vein, by a lengthened passage through
the lungs, in the course of which it is elaborated and
becomes of a crimson colour. Mingled with the inspired
air in this passage, and freed from fuliginous
vapours by the act of expiration, the mixture being
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
now complete in every respect, and the blood become
fit dwelling-place of the vital spirit, it is finally attracted
by the diastole, and reaches the left ventricle of the
heart.</p>

<p>‘Now that the communication and elaboration take
place in the lungs in the manner described, we are
assured by the conjunctions and communications of
the pulmonary artery with the pulmonary vein. The
great size of the pulmonary artery seems of itself to
declare how the matter stands; for this vessel would
neither have been of such a size as it is, nor would such
a force of the purest blood have been sent through it
to the lungs for their nutrition only; neither would the
heart have supplied the lungs in such fashion, seeing
as we do that the lungs in the fœtus are nourished
from another source&mdash;those membranes or valves of
the heart not coming into play until the hour of birth,
as Galen teaches. The blood must consequently be
poured in such large measure at the moment of birth
from the heart to the lungs for another purpose than
the nourishment of these organs. Moreover, it is not
simply air, but air mingled with blood that is returned
from the lungs to the heart by the pulmonary vein.</p>

<p>‘It is in the lungs, consequently, that the mixture [of
the inspired air with the blood] takes place, and it is in
the lungs also, not in the heart, that the crimson colour
of the blood is acquired. There is not indeed capacity
or room enough in the left ventricle of the heart for
so great and important an elaboration, neither does it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
seem competent to produce the crimson colour. To
conclude, the septum or middle partition of the heart,
seeing that it is without vessels and special properties,
is not fitted to permit and accomplish the communication
and elaboration in question, although it may be
that some transudation takes place through it. It is
by a mechanism similar to that by which the transfusion
from the <i>vena port&aelig;</i> to the <i>vena cava</i> takes place
in the liver, in respect of the blood, that the transfusion
from the pulmonary artery to the pulmonary vein
takes place in the lungs, in respect of the spirit.</p>

<p>‘The vital spirit (elaborated in the manner described)
is at length transfused from the left ventricle
of the heart to the arteries of the body at large, and
in such a way that the more attenuated portion tends
upwards, and undergoes further elaboration in the
retiform plexus of vessels situated at the base of the
brain, in which the <i>vital</i> begins to be changed into the
<i>animal</i> spirit, reaching as it now does the proper seat
of the rational soul. Here, still further sublimated and
elaborated by the igneous power of the soul, the blood
is distributed to those extremely minute vessels or
capillary arteries composing the choroid plexus, which
contain or are the seat of the soul itself. The arterial
plexus penetrates even the most intimate part of the
brain, its constituent vessels, interwoven in highly complex
fashion, being distributed over the ventricles, and
sent to the origins of the nerves which subserve the
faculties of sensation and motion. Most wonderfully
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
and delicately interwoven, these vessels, although
spoken of as arteries, are really the terminations of
arteries proceeding to the origins of nerves in the
meninges. They are in truth a new kind of vessels;
for, as in the transfusion from arteries to veins within
the lungs we find a new kind of vessels proceeding
from the arteries and veins, so, in the transfusion from
arteries to nerves, is there a new kind of vessels produced
from the arterial coats and the cerebral meninges.’
‘Chr. Rest.’ p. 170.</p>

<p>There can be no question as to the fact that, in the
above quotation, the passage of the blood from the
right to the left side of the heart through the lungs by
the pulmonary artery and vein, is proclaimed, and a
farther transmission of its more subtle part at least
from the left ventricle of the heart to the arteries of
the body is indicated. After so much said, however,
the account halts. There is no notice of any transfusion
from the arteries to the veins of the body, and so
of a <i>return</i> of the blood by their means to the right side
of the heart&mdash;nor do we believe that anything of the
kind was present to the mind of the writer. The
truth is that Servetus was not thinking of a circulation
of the blood in the sense in which we understand the
term, but of a means of engendering the vital and
animal spirits. ‘The blood,’ he says happily and well,
‘is not sent to the lungs in such large quantity for their
nourishment only. As in the fœtus, so in the adult
are they nourished from another quarter.’ To Servetus
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
as to his age the liver was the fountain of the blood,
and the venous system connected with it the channel
by which materials for the growth and nourishment of
the body were supplied. The heart again was the source
of the heat of the body, and, with the concurrence of
the lungs, the elaboratory of the vital spirits; the arterial
system in connexion with it being the channel
by which the spirit that gives life and special endowment
to the bodily organs is distributed.</p>

<p>Though Servetus saw that the black blood which is
attracted, as he says, by the diastole of the heart from
the vena cava acquires the florid colour in its passage
through the lungs, he never hints at the black blood of
the systemic veins having been the florid blood of the
arteries. We are not, however, to overlook his remark,
though it is only by the way, of ‘the natural spirits
being communicated from the arteries to the veins by
their <i>anastomoses</i>.’ Servetus may consequently have
had an <i>intimation</i> of the systemic circulation; but he
did not think out his thought. He does not speak of
an intermediate system of vessels between the arteries
and veins of the body as of certain other corresponding
vessels of the lungs; and when we find him making
the arteries of the brain terminate in the nerves or
meninges&mdash;the source of the nerves to the old physiologists,
we can only conclude that he believed the arteries
of the body to end in like manner in the several
tissues to which they are distributed. From what he
says further concerning the life of the fœtus in utero,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
we learn positively that Servetus had not divined the
systemic circulation. ‘The embryo lives through the
soul of the mother,’ says he, ‘it is as it were a part of
the mother, the vital spirit being communicated to it
by the umbilical arteries.’ Instead of <i>afferent</i> canals
of the blood from the heart of the fœtus to the placenta
of the mother, consequently, Servetus believed the
umbilical arteries to be <i>efferent</i> channels of the vital
spirit of the mother to the heart of the fœtus. He at
the same time, doubtless, saw the umbilical veins as
the channels by which material for its growth and
nutrition was brought from the mother to be distributed
by the venous system proceeding from the liver
and vena cava, in conformity with the physiological
views of his age. Servetus did not think of the fœtal
heart save as the passive recipient of life. He never
heard its rapid tick tack, nor dreamt of it any more
than he did of the heart of the adult as the agent in
the general distribution of the blood in a great circle
from arteries to veins, from veins to arteries, unbroken
in the embryo, but complicated when independent life
is assumed by the necessary passage through the
lungs.</p>

<p>Imperfectly, incompletely, therefore, as the great
function of the circulation is conceived by Servetus,
his account of so much of it as belongs to the pulmonary
system is all his own and an immense advance
on aught that had been imagined before. Had his
‘Restoration of Christianity’ been suffered to get abroad
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
in the world and into the hands of anatomists, we
can hardly imagine that the immortality which now
attaches so truly and deservedly to the great name of
Harvey would have been reserved for him. But save
to a few theologians, who gave no heed to his physiological
speculations, Servetus’s book remained unknown
in the republic of letters, for more than a century after
it had fallen from the press&mdash;no naturalist had seen it
during all that time. So effectually had it been hunted
out and made away with, that of the thousand copies
printed, two only, as we have seen, are now known to
survive. The ‘Christianismi Restitutio’ of Michael
Servetus, consequently, never influenced either speculation
or discovery in connection with the circulation
of the blood. But reading the book as we are now
suffered to do, let us not overlook in its author the
Physiological Genius of his age. Who shall say what
amount of influence the ‘Restoration of Christianity’
might have had upon both Science and Religion had
it been suffered to see the light! For it is not the possession
only, but the pursuit of truth that truly ennobles
man; and in Servetus’s incomplete induction in the
sphere of physics we see the path fairly entered on
that has given to modern science all its triumphs.
Nor pause we here: in the domain of letters and
criticism, he is nowise less in advance of his age than
in physiology. Who among biblical scholars before
Servetus had seen the applicability of so much that is
said in the Psalms and prophetical books of the Jewish
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
Scriptures to men and events contemporaneous with,
when they had not preceded, the times in which their
authors lived? Servetus’s contemporaries among the
Reformers without exception set out from the <i>letter</i>
of the New Testament as the source of their faith,
the warrant for the conclusions they built upon its text.
But he declared that <i>there was a Christian Doctrine
before there was any New Testament</i>; and we now
know that this came not into existence until thirty,
forty, sixty, and in parts as many as 150, years had
passed after the great moral teacher of Nazareth had
expiated his superiority to the shows and superstitions
and errors of his day by the cruel death of the cross.</p>

<p>Had biblical criticism become a science a century
sooner than it did, the world might now by possibility
be nearer the goal of truth as regards the Religious
Idea than it is, and grave doubts have sooner arisen
as to the competency of the barbarous Jews to solve
the mystery of the ‘Something not ourselves’ which
we are led by our nature to conceive and think of as
<i>Cause</i>, and to imagine as over and above this ‘bank
and shoal of Time,’ whereon we pass our lives.</p>

<p>Quitting physiological discussion for his proper
subject, our author approaches the practical part of his
theory of Christianity. Faith is the first element, and
is spoken of as an emotion rather than a cognition&mdash;a
spontaneous movement of the heart, not an act of the
understanding, its essence being belief in the man Jesus
Christ as the Son of God (pp. 297-300). The end and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
object of the whole New Testament teaching, he says,
is to lead men to a belief of this kind (p. 293), whereby
they are reconciled and made acceptable to God, conceive
a detestation for sin and become exemplars and
exponents of the Christian virtues&mdash;Love, Hope, and
Charity. ‘Faith of this kind,’ he continues, ‘makes
us aware of our poverty, of our misery. For if we
believe that the man Jesus is the Son of God, the
Saviour of the world, we already admit that the world
lies in sin and so needs saving.’</p>

<p>Unlike the other Reformers of the Church, Servetus,
in this his latest work as in his first, makes much
less of the Fall of Man and the wrath of God as consequences
of Adam’s transgression. Original sin can
hardly be said to have a place in his system. Sin, he
even says, was not brought forth on earth, but arose
in heaven, through a revolt of the angels under Satan,
who, utterly opposed to God in all things, seduced man
from his allegiance and so obtained the empire which
it was the purpose of Christ’s coming to regain. Instead
of holding the heart of man as utterly evil and corrupt,
he says, ‘that good works are proper and spontaneous
to the individual. By the death of a sinless being on
whom, as sinless, Satan had no hold, he was thrown out
of the law, forfeited the rights he had acquired,
through the disobedience of man, and God recovered
the empire he had lost.’ Satan, therefore, performs a
highly important part in the Christology of Servetus;
but it differs notably from that both of the Roman
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
Catholic and Reformed Churches, in this: that Christ
does not suffer death to satisfy divine justice and reconcile
God to mankind, but to traverse the Devil in
the rights he had acquired by guile. But all such speculations
belong to a former age of the world. They are
the fossils of the speculative stratum in the nature of
man, and only of interest now to reasonable people as
records of the chim&aelig;ras and incongruities that are
engendered by imagination dissevered from science,
when the understanding, instead of leading, is led, and
the unknowable is assumed as foundation adequate to
support conclusions affecting the lives of men in this
world and their fate in Eternity.</p>

<p>Servetus then makes little or nothing of the ‘Corruption
of human nature’ as consequence of Adam’s
transgression, so much insisted on by the Reformed
Clergy, and he entirely rejects their assumption of
man’s incompetence of himself to do anything good.
Satan, however, is still seen as the opponent of God
in the Restored as in the Reformed system. ‘The
Devil intruded himself into all flesh,’ says our ‘Restorer.’
‘<i>Satan is Sin dwelling within us</i>, and to us is
disease and death (p. 385); these being the consequences
of Adam’s transgression (p. 358).’ So much
our author felt himself bound to accept in a literal
sense, for so he finds it written; but he proceeds forthwith
to interpret the text in his own way, and declares
that <i>Adam’s transgression brought no real guiltiness on
mankind; for such can never be incurred through</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
<i>another’s, but only through each man’s own deed</i>, a
previous knowledge of what is good and evil being the
indispensable condition to responsibility. But as a
knowledge of good and evil is only attained when men
arrive at years of discretion, so did Servetus think that
mortal sin was not committed, nor even guilt incurred,
before the twentieth year (pp. 363 and 387). Though
made subject to corporal death and <i>scheol</i> by Adam’s
fault, men do not for this die spiritually; they will
be restored at the last day when Christ comes to judge
the world: ‘As in Adam all die, so in Christ shall all
be made alive’ (1 Corinth. xv.), say the Scriptures
[of the apostle Paul]; and these words, according to our
author, mean that men will not be condemned to the
second or spiritual death because of Adam’s disobedience,
but only when, knowing good and evil, they
have done much amiss of themselves. Servetus,
therefore, speaks of that as a punishment for sin to
which teeming nations of the East look forward as reward
for the ills of life&mdash;Nirwana, a state of unconscious,
everlasting rest! Servetus himself has no
special place,&mdash;no hell either of temporary or eternal
torture for wrong-doing.</p>

<p>We do not remember to have met with the word
<i>atonement</i> in Servetus’s writings. He had evidently
passed beyond the idea of the vengeful Hebrew God
and the shedding of blood as a propitiatory means believed
in by the Christians of his day, and still so commonly
accepted in our own; Servetus’s religion was as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
comprehensive as that of his great Master. ‘Turks,’
says he, ‘pray aright when they address themselves to
God, though they neither know nor believe that God
ever promised anything to the patriarchs.’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Justification</span> is the dogma that is next entered on,
and is said to be by <i>grace</i>: ‘We are justified,’ says
Servetus, following Paul, ‘when we believe in Christ
as the Son of God,’&mdash;in the way he apprehended the
sonship, being of course to be understood. But, escaping
from leading strings, we find him elsewhere
declaring, and still in advance of his day, that all who
of their own natural motion lead good lives, be they
Jews or Pagans, are justified before God, and that the
good life suffices to have men resuscitated in glory.
‘God,’ says he, ‘does not repute us just of his own
good grace only, but also by the merits of our works;
in other words, of our lives.’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the book on the perdition of the world and its
restoration by Christ, which follows, our author has
much on the subject of baptism&mdash;the means or preliminary,
in his eyes, to <span class="smcap">Regeneration</span>. He will not,
however, allow that unbaptized infants can possibly be
looked on as lost souls. ‘The little children whom
Christ blessed,’ says he, ‘were not baptized. How
should the most clement and merciful Lord condemn
those who had never sinned? Did he ever say to the
little ones unbaptized: Go ye accursed into everlasting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
fire? How should he curse those he blessed? They
seem to me to attempt to befool me who say that the
salvation of an unconscious infant depends on my will
to baptize or to leave it unbaptized.’ Opposed to the
baptism of infants as a meaningless and inefficient
ceremony, Servetus was all the more emphatic in his
insistence on the indispensableness of the rite performed
later in life. ‘Jesus was circumcised indeed
as an infant,’ says he, ‘but only baptized when he was
thirty years of age. We ought not, therefore, to approach
the <span class="smcap">Laver of Regeneration</span> before this age
if we would imitate Christ.’ ‘P&aelig;dobaptism,’ says he,
‘is a detestable abomination, an extinction of the Holy
Spirit in the soul of man, a dissolution of the Church
of Christ, a confusion of the whole Christian faith, an
innovation whereby Christ is set aside and his kingdom
trodden under foot. Woe to you, ye baptizers of infancy,
for ye close the kingdom of heaven against mankind&mdash;the
kingdom of heaven into which ye neither enter
yourselves, nor suffer others to enter&mdash;woe! woe!’
He who is baptized in his infancy, consequently, who
believes that he is properly baptized and so neglects
the regenerative rite in years of discretion, according
to Servetus, loses his chance of instant entrance into
Christ’s kingdom on his death. In his comprehensive
charity, however, we fancy Servetus must have a salvo
for such neglect, though we have missed it. If he has
failed to set it forth in words, we feel assured that it
was nevertheless alive in his heart.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span></p>

<p>In the book on the Power of Satan and Antichrist,
Servetus attacks the Papacy in terms of measureless
reprobation, likening the Pope to the Antichrist of the
Apocalypse, calling him the son of perdition, and
speaking of his dominion as the reign of God’s opposite
on earth (p. 393). In exalting himself above
his fellow-men and requiring them to look on him as
a god, the Pope has usurped the forbidden kingdom.
The imposition of a spiritual papacy, he maintains, has
brought more mischief on the spiritual world than the
carnal Adam brought on the world of flesh. For his
sin was Adam condemned to the pain of corporeal
death, and for theirs are the beast and his ministers
(the pope and his council) doomed in the Apocalypse
to the pains of everlasting fire (p. 394).</p>

<p>Against monastic vows of all kinds, Servetus is
here most vehemently outspoken. According to him,
they are mere sacrileges of tradition. He does not
object to the celibate life, however, which he says he
has chosen for himself; but Peter, he thinks, would be
amazed did he see the shaven, cowled, and bedizened
priests engaged in their mimic play, whereby they lead
the people to the most open idolatry. But it is the mendicant
monk that he has in more especial abhorrence.
Him he compares to the locust, which, eating up everything
it encounters, leaves desolation behind. ‘The
locust,’ he says, ‘has by nature a sort of monk’s cowl;
add to this a wallet, and you have a begging friar complete;
in other words, a hooded devil.’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span></p>

<p>In the book on the Lord’s Supper, our author
speaks of course of the papistical transubstantiation,
the annihilation of the <i>bread</i> as bread and its transmutation
into mere <i>whiteness</i>. ‘I rather wonder,’ says
he, ‘whether Satan was the circumcisor of common
sense from the brains of those who of <i>bread</i> make
<i>not-bread</i>, and in its stead produce a vendible whiteness;
for these puny sacrificators, for a mouthful of
whiteness given without wine, make us count out our
money (p. 510). To such degradation of mind are
these men brought that they call that the true body of
Christ, which, in the whiteness they imagine, rats and
dogs might devour. Never was there any such blindness
as this among the Jews&mdash;blindness the more
notable as the Papists say they are infallible (p. 511).
But as circumcision of the foreskin makes the Jew, and
circumcision of the heart the Christian, so does circumcision
of the scalp make the sham Jew, the papal
sacrificial priest and slave of Antichrist.’</p>

<p>He is scarcely more complimentary when he speaks
of the views of the Reformers on the subject of the
Supper, styling the Lutherans <i>Impanators</i>, and the
Calvinists <i>Tropists</i>, the Roman Catholics being of
course <i>Transubstantiators</i>. If we understand him
aright, he looks on the Supper as something more than
a simple commemorative feast, to be first partaken of
immediately after adult baptism, to which it is the necessary
complement; but we are startled after what, as
we interpret it, he has just said in this sense, when we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
by and by find him speaking as if he believed that the
body and blood of Christ were really partaken of in
the Christian Communion (p. 281 and Letter xxx. to
Calvin). The contradictory statements met with in the
writings of Servetus, however, as we have had occasion
oftener than once already to say, can only be harmonised
by taking note of his pantheistic views. In the
instance before us, for example, on the pantheistic
principle, as God is in and of the substance of all things,
so was He in Christ, or Christ, in so far, was God. In
consonance with the <i>letter</i>, therefore the bread and wine
of the solemn rite are flesh and blood. The language
of mysticism, however, is often little intelligible to the
naturalist, who in his incapacity here may be likened to
those who, with ears otherwise acute, cannot distinguish
certain extremely acute or grave sounds, or who, with
eyes otherwise excellent, see no difference between
such opposite colours as red and green. Like the Reformers
of all denominations, Servetus maintained the
<span class="smcap">Cup</span> to be an indispensable element in the celebration
of the Supper. In the Papal Mass, he says, there is
no true Communion. The bread is not broken in
common, and the wine is appropriated by the Sacrificator,
even as the Babylonian Priests of old appropriated
the oblations of the altar: ‘Quorban,’ says the
Popish Priest as he drinks, to the lookers on, ‘it will
do you good, too.’ (p. 522).</p>

<p>Singularly enough, when we think of what he
has to say in disparagement of the Roman Catholic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
priesthood, we find him recognising in <i>ministers</i> a
power to absolve men from their sins and reconcile
them to God&mdash;<i>potestas ministris est remittendi peccata
et reconciliandi homines Deo</i> (p. 516). This, we can
only conclude, is said because of what he found in the
Sacred Text;<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> no word of which, as we know, would
he gainsay. But that Michael Servetus, mystic though
he was, believed in his soul that one man can absolve
another of his sin, we do not think possible. He did
not surmise that the fourth gospel was only written a
hundred and fifty years after the death of Jesus, and
by a Neo-platonic philosopher, presumably of Alexandria,
fashioner, like Paul of Tarsus, of a Christology
and Christianity of his own.</p>

<p>In illustration of the character of the man, the study
of whose life engages us, the prayer with which he
concludes the book on the ‘Restoration of Christianity’&mdash;for
here the work does end in fact, all that follows being
but by way of appendix&mdash;ought not to be overlooked.
It is in immediate sequence to a renewed
phillipic against the baptizers of infants, and to the
following effect:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Almighty Father! Father of all mercy, free us
miserable men from this darkness of death, for the sake
of thy Son Jesus Christ Our Lord. O Jesus Christ,
thou Son of God, who died for us, help us, lest we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
perish! We, thy suppliants, pray to thee as thou
hast taught us, saying, Hallowed be thy Name; thy
kingdom come; and do thou, Lord, come! thy
bride the Church, praying in the Apocalypse, says,
Come! The spirits of thy children, praying here,
say, Come! Let all who hear this pray and cry aloud,
and with John exclaim, Come! Thou Who hast said,
I come quickly (Apocalypse xxii.) wilt surely come,
and with thy coming put an end to Antichrist. So be
it. Amen!’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The first of the additions to the system of ‘Restored
Christianity’ are the thirty letters to Calvin, which we
have already analysed, in what seemed the appropriate
place.</p>

<p>The book or chapter on the ‘Sixty signs of the
reign of Antichrist, and of his presence among us,’ which
follows, need not detain us. The signs are for the most
part arbitrarily assumed by the writer, on the ground
that his own views are the truth, those of the Papists
and Reformers mistaken, false, or short of the truth.
Having shown to his own satisfaction that every evil-doer,
in the shape of an exalted personage who has
ever appeared in the world, even from Satan, Nimrod,
and Nebuchadnezzar, prefigured the Pope, and that
the Pope is Antichrist, he then very logically concludes
that all the dogmas and doctrines sanctioned by the
Papacy are of the Devil. Under this category he
places the doctrine of the Trinity in the foremost rank,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
then the Baptism of Infants, the Mass, Transubstantiation,
all but everything, in short, characteristic of Roman
Catholic Christianity. As in so many other places, he
is here also ready with a prayer, which we quote as
ever-recurring testimony to the sincerely, but misunderstood,
pious nature of the man:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘O Christ Jesus, Son of God, most merciful Liberator,
who hast so often freed thy people from their
straits, free us too from this Babylonian Captivity of
Antichrist, from his hypocrisy, his tyranny, his idolatry!
Amen.’</p>

<p>The concluding part of the ‘Restoration of Christianity’
is an address to Melanchthon and his colleagues
on the Mystery of the Trinity and the discipline of the
ancient Church. We have seen that Melanchthon of
all the Reformers was the one who seemed to be most
taken by the theological speculations of the seven books
on Trinitarian error. ‘I read Servetus a great deal,’
says he to his friend Camerarius; and if he found the
work objectionable in many respects, as he says, it yet
contained matter that would not be put aside, but that
forced itself on his attention, and may be presumed to
have influenced his final conclusions on some of the
highest and most difficult doctrines of orthodox Christianity.
Certain it is that the first and earlier editions
of his highly popular work, the ‘Loci Theologici,’ differ
notably from those that appeared subsequently to the
publication of Servetus’s ‘De Erroribus Trinitatis.’
In the first and earlier editions there is nothing said
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
of God, whether as One or Triune, of Creation, the
Incarnation, and other purely speculative matters.
‘These subjects,’ he says, ‘are wholly incomprehensible,
and we more properly adore than attempt to
investigate the mystery of Deity. What, I ask you,’
he continues, ‘has been the outcome of the scholastic
and theological discussions that have gone on for all
these ages?’ But the metaphysics of Christianity
were not passed over in any such way by Servetus.
His earliest work even meets us in some sort as a
complementary criticism of the ‘Loci’ of Melanchthon,
and that it was so held by the Reformer seems to be
demonstrated by the many changes and additions to be
noticed in the revised edition of the work of the year
1535, the first that was published after the appearance
of the ‘De Erroribus Trinitatis’ and ‘Dialogi duo de
Trinitate.’<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></p>

<p>Finding himself very freely handled in the revised
editions of the ‘Loci,’ his <i>errors</i>, as they are designated
as matter of course, being assimilated to those of Paul
of Samosata and others, and his references to Tertullian
and the ante-Nic&aelig;an Fathers proclaimed irrelevant,
Servetus retorts, and, throwing moderation to the
winds, proceeds in the diatribe we have before us to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
pour out the vials of his displeasure on the head of the
great Wittemberg scholar and theologian. Our Restorer
of Christianity does, it is true, see Melanchthon
as somewhat nearer the mark than Luther, Calvin, and
Œcolampadius; but the references made to Athanasius,
Augustin, and the Fathers who came after the Council
of Nic&aelig;a, are all put out of court&mdash;their conclusions are
of non-avail; for they had all bowed the knee to the
Beast, and bore his mark. The true Church of Christ
had already forsaken the earth in their day, and their
teaching on the Trinity, Baptism, the Supper, &amp;c., was
nought. Strange to say, as proceeding from a scholar,
himself no indifferent master of the Latin tongue, he
reproaches Melanchthon with the elegance of his
Latinity. The Holy Ghost, says he, never spoke in
fine phrases! (P. 674.)</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is difficult to conceive a man not utterly bereft
of reason and common sense, living among Roman
Catholics and in times of deadly persecution for heresy,
writing in the style of Servetus on the Papacy and
the most accredited tenets of Christianity. Yet is it
impossible to imagine that he was blind to the danger
he incurred in doing so; neither do we believe that he
knowingly and advisedly staked his life against the
cause he certainly had so much at heart. He may
have said, indeed, that he believed he should die for his
opinions; but we see him taking what he must have
meant as sufficient precautions against such a contingency;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
and when first brought face to face with the
prospect of accomplishing the destiny he foreshadowed,
we find him showing anything but the recklessness of
the true martyr. We presume that the security in
which he had dwelt so long under his assumed name,
the immunity from suspicion of heresy he had enjoyed
since the publication of his first work, and the latitude
allowed him by his clerical friends of Vienne in discussing
the heresies of the Reformers&mdash;and it may be
also some of a minor sort of their own&mdash;misled him.
His seven books on erroneous conceptions of the Trinity
appear to have been little, if at all, known to the ecclesiastics
of France; and he probably imagined that in
appealing to the press again and keeping his work from
the booksellers’ shops of the country of his adoption,
he would continue to be overlooked. Anything of a
heretical nature he should publish now might possibly
be challenged by the German and Swiss Reformers;
but they were heretics in the eyes of the Viennese,
and, provided he did not openly proclaim himself the
author, their ill report, if perchance it ever reached
France, would do the author of the ‘Restoration of
Christianity’ no harm, if it did not even tend to exalt
him among orthodox adherents of the Church of Rome.</p>

<p>Every reasonable precaution therefore taken that
the new book on the Restoration of Christianity should
not get abroad in France, Servetus seems to have
thought himself safe against detection and pursuit.
He was in fact altogether unknown, as we have said,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
in the place of his residence as Michael Serveto, alias
Rev&eacute;s, of Aragon, in Spain. He was M. Michel
Villeneuve, Physician of Vienne, and living under the
patronage of its Archbishop. There was, however, so
strong a family likeness between the ‘Seven Books
and Two Dialogues on Trinitarian Error’ and the
‘Restoration of Christianity,’ or the views therein contained,
that the most cursory comparison of the two
works would have disclosed their common parentage,
even if the writer of the ‘Restoration’ had not himself
hinted plainly enough at the fact. He must have
thought himself perfectly safe in his incognito at
Vienne, and seems not to have dreamt of danger from
abroad. There could be no reason, therefore, why
Calvin, and through him the other Reformers of
Switzerland, should not be made aware of what he
had been about. He would in truth take his place
beside or above them all as the real Restorer of Christianity,
proclaimer, as he believed himself to be, of the
true doctrine concerning Christ as the naturally begotten
Son of God; of the Salvation to be secured by faith
in him as such; of the Regeneration to be effected by
baptism performed in years of discretion, and of the
absurdity implied in imagining division in the essence
of God, and instead of the One great Creator of heaven
and earth, having a Three-headed chim&aelig;ra for a Deity!
In this view, as we conclude, he sent a copy of his
book to Calvin; and with consequences which it will
now be our business to follow to their disastrous conclusion;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
for all that remains of the life of Michael
Servetus, cut short in the flower of his age, is entirely
subordinated to influences brought to bear on it through
the printing of this work and the interference of the
Reformer of Geneva.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a>

<p class="center">CALVIN RECEIVES A COPY OF THE ‘CHRISTIANISMI
RESTITUTIO.’</p>

<p>Frelon, the publisher of Lyons, whom we already
know as the medium of communication between Villeneuve
and Calvin in their correspondence, was probably
by this time in the secret of the Spaniard. The
friend of Calvin as well as intimate with Villeneuve,
had he not already been confided in by the subject
of our study, he must have been informed by Calvin
who Michel Villeneuve really was. The correspondence
had long ceased, but the intercourse between
the Bookseller and the Reformer continued, and the
‘monthly parcel’ was still the vehicle for new books
and literary gossip between Lyons and Geneva. By
Frelon’s February dispatch of the year 1553, we
therefore conclude that there went a copy of the
‘Christianismi Restitutio,’ hot from the press, specially
addressed to Monsieur Jehann Calvin, Minister of
Geneva. That it was accompanied by a letter from
Frelon we may also presume, giving in all innocency
and confidence&mdash;little recking what use would be made
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
of the information&mdash;those particulars connected with
the printing of the work which Frelon must have had
from Villeneuve, and which Calvin by and by imparted
to the authorities of Lyons and Vienne.</p>

<p>Frelon may be supposed not yet to have read the
‘Christianismi Restitutio;’ but aware of Villeneuve’s
appreciation of the Church of Rome, and trusting to the
author’s own account of his work as especially hostile
to the papacy, he may have thought that it would not
be otherwise than well received by Calvin. It is only
with Frelon as go-between that we can account for the
book having reached Calvin at the early date it did, and
for the particular information he possessed concerning
Arnoullet as the printer, and the precautions that had
been taken to keep the world ignorant of what had
been done. That there was no intention of betraying
trust on Frelon’s part, we need not doubt; and still
less, as we believe, need we question the fact that it
was not only with the author’s consent, but by his
express desire, that the first copy of the ‘Christianismi
Restitutio’ sent abroad went to the Reformer.</p>

<p>Servetus himself could at this time have had as little
idea, as Frelon, of the deadly hate with which Calvin was
animated towards him. They had corresponded and differed,
had quarrelled and called each other opprobrious
names; but controversialists did so habitually, when
they got heated; and the epithets then so freely bandied
about were scarcely seriously meant, and hardly
ever seriously taken: they were but the seasoning to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
the matter, nothing more. Servetus was in truth far
too vain, and at the same time too much under the spell
of Calvin, to leave him of all men else in ignorance of
the important work of which he had just been happily
delivered. With the earliest opportunity therefore
that occurred, and before the book had been seen by
another, as we believe, he sent a copy to Calvin, meaning
it doubtless as a compliment&mdash;a return perhaps for
the copy of the ‘Institutiones Religionis Christian&aelig;’
we credit him with having received from its author.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to imagine the alarm that must at
once have taken possession of Calvin’s mind when he
saw the errors, the heresies, the blasphemies, as he regarded
them, which in bygone years he had vainly
sought to combat, now confided to the printed page
and ready to be thrown broadcast on the world. And
more than this: if his ire had been already roused by
the strictly confidential correspondence to the extent of
leading him to threaten the life of the writer, did
occasion offer, what additional anger must now have
entered into his heart, when, besides the offensive
heretical matter of the book, he found himself taken to
task, publicly schooled, declared to be in error, and his
most cherished doctrines not only controverted, but
proclaimed derogatory to God, and some of them even
as barring the gates of heaven against all who adopted
them! What, too, on second thoughts, may have
been his exultation when, in perusing the book, he found
his enemy committing himself so egregiously in abusing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
the Papacy, and supplying evidence that would convict
him at once of blasphemy against God and the Church,
and, in sending him to the stake&mdash;as he foresaw it must
in a Roman Catholic country&mdash;would rid the world at
once of an agent of Satan, and a personal enemy!

<p class="center">CALVIN DENOUNCES SERVETUS THROUGH WILLIAM TRIE
TO THE ECCLESIASTICAL AUTHORITIES OF LYONS.</p>

<p>Calvin’s mind must have been immediately made up
after perusing the ‘Restoration of Christianity.’ He
would denounce its author as a heretic and blasphemer
to the ecclesiastical authorities of France, and&mdash;<i>Deus
ex machina</i>&mdash;an instrument was at hand to further
his purpose. There lived at this time in Geneva a
certain William Trie, a native of Lyons, a convert from
the Romish to the Reformed faith, and, as proselyte,
well known to Calvin. Trie, it would appear, had not
been left altogether at peace in his new profession of
faith. He had a relation, Arneys by name, resident in
Lyons, who did not cease from reproaching him by
letter as a renegade, and exhorting him to think better
of it, and return to the faith he had forsaken. Trie
would seem to have been in the habit of showing his
letters to Calvin, and of having aid and advice from
him in answering them; Calvin, it was said, upon
occasion even dictating the epistles in reply. But now
he could use the neophyte in his own as well as the
general behalf, and set about the business forthwith
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
under cover of a letter from the convertite Trie to his
relation Arneys:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Monsieur mon Cousin,&mdash;I have to thank you much for
your fine remonstrances, and make no question of your
friendly purpose in seeking to bring me back to the point
from which I started. As I am not a man of letters like you,
I do not enter on the points and articles you bring up against
me. Not, indeed, but that with such knowledge as God has
given me, I could find plenty to say in the way of reply; for,
God be praised, I am not so ill-grounded as not to know that
the true Church has Jesus Christ for its head, from whom it
cannot be dissevered, and that there is neither life nor salvation
apart from Holy Scripture. All you say to me of the
Church, I therefore hold for phantasm, unless Christ, as having
supreme authority, presides therein, and the Word of God is
made the foundation of its teaching. Without this, all your
formulas are nothing.... As to what you say about there
being so much more of freedom, or latitude of opinion, with
us here than with you, still we should never suffer the name
of God to be blasphemed, nor evil doctrines and opinions to
be spread abroad among us, without let or hinderance.
And I can give you an instance which, I must say, I think
tends to your confusion. It is this: that a certain heretic is
countenanced among you, who ought to be burned alive,
wherever he might be found. And when I say a heretic, I
refer to a man who deserves to be as summarily condemned
by the Papists, as he is by us. For though differing in many
things, we agree in believing that in the sole essence of God
there be three persons, and that his Son, who is his Eternal
Wisdom, was engendered by the Father before all time, and
has had [imparted to him] his Eternal virtue, which is the
Holy Spirit. But when a man appears who calls the Trinity
we all believe in, a Cerberus and Monster of Hell, who disgorges
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
all the villainies it is possible to imagine, against
everything Scripture teaches of the Eternal generation of the
Son of God, and mocks besides open-mouthed at all that the
ancient doctors of the Church have said&mdash;I ask you in what
regard you would have such a man?... I must speak
freely: What shame is it not that they are put to death
among you who say that one God only is to be invoked in
the name of Christ; that there is no service acceptable to
God other than that which He has approved by His word;
and that all the pictures and images which men make are but
so many idols which profane His majesty?... What shame,
say I, is it not, that such persons are not only put to death
in no easy and simple way, but are cruelly burned alive?
Nevertheless, there is one living among you who calls Jesus
Christ an idol; who would destroy the foundations of the
faith; who condemns the baptism of little children, and calls
the rite a diabolical invention. Where, I pray you, is the zeal
to which you make pretence; where are your guardians and
that fine hierarchy of which you boast so much? The man
I refer to has been condemned in all the Churches you hold
in such dislike, but is suffered to live unmolested among you,
to the extent of even being permitted to print books full of
such blasphemies as I must not speak of further. He is a
Spanish-Portuguese, Michael Servetus by name, though he
now calls himself Villeneuve, and practises as a physician.
He lived for some time at Lyons, and now resides at Vienne,
where the book I speak of was printed by one Balthasar
Arnoullet. That you may not think I speak of mere hearsay
I send you the first few leaves as a sample, for your assurance.
You say that our books, which contain nothing but the purity
and simplicity of Holy Scripture, infect the world; yet you
brew poisons among you which go to destroy the Scriptures
and all you hold as Christianity. I have been longer than I
thought; but the enormity of the case causes me to exceed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
I need not, I imagine, go into particulars; I only pray you to
put it somewhat seriously to your conscience, and conclude
for yourself, to the end that when you appear before the
Great Judge you may not be condemned. For, to say it in a
word, we have here no subject of difference or debate, and ask
but this: That God himself may be heard. Concluding for
the present, I pray that He may give you ears to hear, and a
heart to obey, having you at all times in His holy keeping.</p>

<p>Geneva, this 26th of February [1553].</p></blockquote>

<p>This on the face of it is no letter from one young
man to another. It is the artful production of the
zealot and bigot in one, well informed of the antecedents
of the man he is denouncing, and but poorly
disguised by the name under which he is writing. The
letter from first to last is Calvin’s, and was accompanied
by the two first leaves of the newly printed book, the
‘Christianismi Restitutio,’ containing the title and
table of contents, sufficient, as Calvin knew full well, to
alarm the hierarchs of Papal Christianity, which in their
estimation needed no restoration, and was indeed
susceptible of none; whilst any discussion of such
transcendental topics as the Trinity, Faith in Christ,
Regeneration, Baptism, and the Reign of Antichrist,
smacked at best of schism when undertaken by a layman
even of orthodox views, but became flat blasphemy
when treated by such a one in any adverse sense.</p>

<p>Cardinal Tournon, at this time Archbishop of Lyons,
was the implacable enemy of all innovators, and in his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
zeal for what he believed to be the truth well disposed
to resort to the severest measures against the spread
of heresy, which to him and his co-religionists, then as
now, was most especially embodied in the principles of
Luther and Calvin’s Reformation. Exposed as were
the south and east of France from their contiguity with
Switzerland to infection of the kind, Tournon had not
relied exclusively on himself and his own subordinate
clergy as watchers over the faith of the district under
his charge. He had further summoned to his aid one
of the regularly trained inquisitors from Rome, Matthew
Ory by name, who designated himself: <i>P&eacute;nitencier du
Saint Si&eacute;ge Apostolique, et Inquisiteur g&eacute;n&eacute;ral du
Royaume de France et dans toutes les Gaules</i>. This
man, as we may imagine, had a real relish for his calling
and was watchfulness itself in ferreting out heresy, as,
with all of his kind, he was relentless in pursuing it to
the death.</p>

<p>The notable letter of Trie to Arneys was immediately
brought under the notice of the clergy of Lyons,
as Calvin intended and foresaw that it would be; and
by one of them, was communicated to Ory, the Inquisitor,
and to Bautier, Vicar-General, and Canon of the
Cathedral Church of Lyons. Here was work of more
than common interest to the Inquisitor, who proceeded
forthwith, under date of March 12, 1553, to write to
Villars, Auditor of Cardinal Tournon, absent at the moment
from Lyons, but no farther away than his Ch&acirc;teau
of Roussillon, a few miles distant from Vienne.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span></p>

<p>The letter of Ory is highly characteristic of the
jesuitical, stealthy, and underhand style of dealing with
all that belongs to free thought and open speech.
Premising a few sentences on indifferent and private
matters, he comes anon to the real gist of his letter and
says: ‘I would advise you in all secrecy of some books
that are now being imprinted at Vienne, containing
execrable blasphemies against the divinity of Jesus
Christ and the Holy Trinity, the author and printer of
which are both living among you. The Vicar-General
and I have seen one of the chapters of this publication,
and are of like mind about the propriety of your taking
an early opportunity of conferring with Monseigneur
(the Cardinal) and making him more particularly acquainted
with the business; so that on your return
home the necessary orders may be given by Monseigneur
to M. Maugiron, the Vibailly of Vienne, and the
police. So much at this time M. the Vicar-General
desires that you should know through me; but you
are to proceed so secretly that your left hand shall not
know what your right is about&mdash;<i>mais si secr&egrave;tement
que vostre main senextre n’entend point ce que c’est</i>.
Only whisper in the ear of Monseigneur and inform us
if he has any knowledge of a certain Villeneufve, a
physician, and one Arnoullet, a bookseller, both of
Vienne, for it is to them that I refer.’</p>

<p>On the following day the Vicar Bautier left Lyons
for Roussillon and saw the Cardinal, who immediately
sent a letter to Louis Arzelier, Grand Vicar of the See
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
of Vienne, summoning him to Roussillon. After a
long conference, Arzelier was ordered to return to
Vienne and deliver an autograph letter from the
Cardinal to M. de Maugiron, Lieutenant-General of
Dauphiny, in which however there is nothing said of
the affair he has at heart (for this he will only trust to
be communicated by word of mouth by M. the Vicar
to M. the Lieutenant); but appealing to the known
zeal of his correspondent for the honour of God and
his church, and adding, in anticipation of what he
knew would follow, a request that he should immediately
summon the Vibailly to his assistance, in
order that he, on his part, might undertake what M. the
Vicar might see necessary to be done. Two things
only are especially to be required of the Vibailly: the
one that he use extreme dispatch, the other that the
business be kept as secret as possible. Roussillon,
March 15, 1553.</p>

<p>Acting at once on the advice of the Cardinal,
Maugiron sent to the Vibailly, bidding him hold himself
ready to act in a certain unspecified contingency.
Next day, March 16, the two Vicars in company with
the Vibailly proceeded to the office of the Sieur
Peyrolles, Lay official of the Primate, before whom
Bautier, as the party immediately interested in virtue
of his office, made a deposition to the effect that within
the last few days letters had been received from Geneva
addressed to a personage resident in Lyons, in which
great surprise was expressed that a certain Michael
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
Servetus, otherwise called Villanovanus, should be then
living unmolested at Vienne; that four printed leaves
of a book written by the said Villanovanus had also
been forwarded from Geneva and examined by brother
Ory, Inquisitor of the Faith, by whom they had been
found heretical; and, to conclude, that the Cardinal
Archbishop, having been made acquainted with the
matter, had written to M. de Maugiron requesting him
to take cognizance of the business with all secrecy and
dispatch. Bautier, at the same time, put in the Geneva
letter of Trie, and the four leaves of the printed book
entitled ‘<i>Christianismi Restitutio</i>,’ in support of his
allegations; the letter of the Inquisitor and that of the
Cardinal to Maugiron being added as further documents
on which the Procurator of the King and the Justiciary
were to proceed.</p>

<p>The judicial authorities of Vienne lost no time in
obeying their instructions. On the same day they met
at the house of M. Maugiron, and having consulted
with him, they sent to M. Michel de Villeneuve, desiring
his presence and saying they had something to communicate
to him. Being from home when the message
arrived, and not appearing for a couple of hours, the
authorities were fearful that he had been somehow
warned of the danger which threatened him and so
had fled; but their fears were unfounded: he came at
length, and with a perfectly confident air, it is said.
The authorities informed him that they had certain
informations against him which would make it necessary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
for them to visit and search his lodgings for books
or papers of a heretical tendency. Villeneuve replied
that he had lived long at Vienne on good terms with
the clergy and professors of theology, and had never
until now been suspected of heresy; but he was quite
ready to open his rooms to them or those they might
delegate, to make what search they pleased.</p>

<p>The Grand Vicar and the Vibailly, accompanied by
the Secretary of the Cardinal Governor of Dauphiny,
then proceeded with Villeneuve to his apartments, which
adjoined and were among the dependencies of the
archiepiscopal palace, and made a particular examination
of his papers; but they found nothing more compromising
than a couple of copies of his apology or pamphlet
against the Parisian Doctors, of which they took
possession.</p>

<p>Next day, the 17th, the Judges made a perquisition
in the house of Arnoullet, the publisher and printer, in
his absence, he being away at the time on business at
Toulouse; and there also they had Geroult, the superintendent
of the printing establishment, brought before
them. After a lengthened interrogatory of the
foreman, in which nothing was elicited, they proceeded
to search the house and printing office, examining
Arnoullet’s papers minutely, but without finding a word
to compromise him in any way. The workmen on the
establishment were then severally examined. They
were shown the printed leaves of the ‘Christianismi
Restitutio’ and asked if they knew anything of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
book of which the leaves were a part; or if they recognised
the type, or could give any information as to
the books they had had a hand in composing or printing
during the last eighteen months or so. But they
all agreed in saying that the four leaves shown them
had not been printed in the office; and among all the
books that had issued from their presses during the
last two years, a list of which was supplied, there was
not one in the octavo form. The search and inquiry
over, the officials had the entire staff of the printing
establishment brought into their presence, and cautioned
them against saying a word of all they had been
asked about, on pain of being declared suspected or
even convicted of heresy and punished accordingly.</p>

<p>On the 18th, Arnoullet, having but just returned
from Toulouse, was visited and examined; but all the
papers about him being found in order and his replies
in complete conformity with those of his manager
Geroult, he too was dismissed. The authorities found
themselves at fault, but by no means satisfied that the
information they had had from Geneva was groundless.
An adjournment was therefore resolved on, an informal
consultation being, however, held meantime at
the archiepiscopal palace of Vienne. And it is not
perhaps without significance that it is only now that we
find the archbishop of Vienne, Pierre Paumier, named
in connection with the proceedings, and his palace
spoken of as the place of assembly. It was at this
moment in fact that Paumier had the first intimation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
of what was going on. At the meeting it was decided
that nothing had been discovered sufficiently positive
to warrant the arrest of anyone.</p>

<p>The archbishop of Vienne, once made a party to the
proceedings, appears to have taken up the case warmly.
The known protector and frequent associate of Villeneuve
the physician, he seems to have thought it incumbent
on him to show the world that he had no
sympathy with heresy, and nothing in common with a
suspected heretic. He accordingly wrote immediately
to Brother Ory, the Inquisitor, begging him to come
to Vienne and have some conversation with him on
matters touching the Faith. In the course of the interview
which followed, Ory suggested that, in order to
have further or more satisfactory information against
Villeneuve, Arneys should be made to write again to
his relation Trie at Geneva, and ask him to send the
whole of the printed book from which the leaves already
forwarded had been cut. Returning to Lyons,
Ory himself, we must presume, dictated the letter which
Arneys was required to write to his cousin Trie. This
epistle unhappily has not reached us. It would have
been both curious and interesting to have had the Inquisitor
of three centuries and a half ago brought so
immediately before us, as we should there have had
him. But as Ory doubtless led the pen at Lyons, so
did Calvin assuredly guide it again at Geneva in reply;
and as his letter has been preserved, we come face to
face with one who is still more interesting to us than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
brother Matthew Ory, Inquisitor of the kingdom of
France and all the Gauls&mdash;with the great head of the
Reformed Churches of France and Switzerland, at the
zenith of his power, though not without misgivings as to
its stability, zealous as brother Ory could have been
in upholding the Faith as he apprehended it, and as ruthless
as Cardinal Tournon in dealing with all who called
it in question. The letter is to the following effect:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Monsieur mon Cousin!&mdash;When I wrote the letter you
have thought fit to impart to those who are taxed therein
with indifference and neglect, I thought not that the matter
would be taken up so seriously as it seems to be. My sole
purpose was to show you the fine zeal and devotion of those
who call themselves pillars of the Church, suffering as they do
such disorder among themselves, yet persecuting so cruelly
poor Christians who only desire to obey God in simplicity.
As the instance was so notable, however, and I was advised
of it, an opportunity presented itself, as I thought, of touching
on it, the matter falling, as it seemed, fairly within the scope
of my writing. But as you have shown to others the letter I
meant for yourself alone, God grant that it tend to purge
Christianity of such filth, of pestilence so mortal to man! If
your people are really so anxious to look into the matter as
you say, there will be no difficulty in furnishing you, besides
the printed book you ask for, with documents enough to carry
conviction to their minds. For I shall put into your hands
some two dozen pieces written by him who is in question, in
which some of his heresies are set prominently forth. Did
you rely on the printed book by itself, he might deny it as
his; but this he could not do if his own handwriting were
brought against him. In this way, the parties you speak of,
having the thing completely proven, will be without excuse if
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
they hesitate further, or put off taking the steps required.
All the pieces I send you now&mdash;the great volume as well as
the letters in the handwriting of the author&mdash;were produced
before the printed work; but I have to own to you that I had
great difficulty in getting these documents from Mons. Calvin.
Not that he would not have such execrable blasphemies put
down; but that, as he does not wield the sword of justice himself,
he thinks it his duty rather to repress heresy by sound
teaching, than to pursue it by force. I importuned him, however,
so much, showing him the reproaches I might incur did
he not come to my aid, that he consented at length to entrust
me with the contents of my parcel to you. For the rest,
I hope, when the case shall have been somewhat farther advanced,
to obtain from him something like a whole ream of
paper, which the fine fellow&mdash;<i>le Galand</i>&mdash;has had printed.
At the moment, I fancy you are furnished with evidence
enough, and that there need be no more beating about the
bush, before seizing on his person and putting him on his
trial. For my own part, I pray God to open the eyes
of those who speak of us so evilly, to the end that they
may more truly judge of the motives by which we are
actuated.</p>

<p>As I learn by your letter that you will not trouble me
further with the old proposals, I, on my side, will do nothing
to displease you; hoping nevertheless, that God will lead you
to see that I have not, without due consideration, taken the
step you disapprove. Recommending myself to your favour,
and praying God to give you his, &amp;c., I remain,</p>

<p class="author">

<p>Geneva, this 26th of March.</p></blockquote>

<p>The art and purpose so plainly to be seen in the
foregoing letter need not be dwelt on. Anxious to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
escape appearing in the odious light of informer, Calvin
was still eager to furnish the zealots of the Church he
had quitted himself, and by the heads of which he was
looked on as standing in the foremost ranks of heresy,
with evidence which he believed would assuredly bring
the man he held in despite to a cruel death by fire.
But Ory, whose special business was the prosecution of
heretics, and who knew much better than Calvin what
constituted evidence against them, was aware that the
MS. book and the two dozen pieces, written as said
by Michael Servetus, were not adequate to convict
Michel Villeneuve of the charge against him.
Handwriting, it seems, could be put out of court as
evidence in cases of heresy, through simple denial on
oath by the party accused. The point upon which
evidence was particularly required, by Ory and his coadjutors,
was in fact the <i>printing</i> of the book entitled
the ‘Restoration of Christianity;’ and none of the
pieces furnished gave any assurance either that
Michel Villeneuve was the writer, or Arnoullet and
Geroult the printers of this. Arneys must therefore
be desired to write to Cousin Trie once more, and ask
him to do his best with M. Calvin to furnish evidence
of the kind required. So anxious indeed were Ory
and his friends for this, that they despatched this, the
third letter of Arneys to Trie, by a special messenger,
who was ordered to wait and bring back the answer
with all speed.</p>

<p>The answer came in due course, hardly, however,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
so soon as we can fancy it was looked for, but to the
following effect:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Monsieur mon Cousin!&mdash;I had hoped I should satisfy
your demands, in essentials at least, by sending you, as I did,
the handwriting of the author of the book. With my last
letter, indeed, you will find an acknowledgement by the man
himself of his real name, which he had disguised, and the excuse
he makes for calling himself Villeneuve, when his proper
name is Servetus or Rev&eacute;s. For the rest, I promise you, God
willing, to furnish you, if need be, not only with the entire
book he has just had printed, but with another in his handwriting,
in addition to the letters [already forwarded]. I
should indeed have already sent the book [in MS.] which I
refer to, had it been in this city; but it has been at Lausanne
these two years past. Had M. Calvin kept it by him, I believe
he would long ago, for all it is worth, have returned it to
the writer; but having lent it for perusal to another, it was, as
it seems, retained by him. I have formerly heard Monsieur
[Calvin] say that, having given answers sufficient to satisfy any
reasonable man, to no purpose, he had at length left off reading
more of the babble and foolish reveries, of which he soon
had had more than enough, there being nothing but reiteration
of the same song over and over again. And that you
may understand that it is not of yesterday that this unhappy
person persists in troubling the Church, striving ever to lead
the ignorant into the same confusion as himself, it is now
more than twenty-four years since he was rejected and expelled
by the chief Churches of Germany; had he remained
in that country, indeed, he would never have left it alive.
Among the letters of Œcolampadius, you will see that the first
and second are addressed to him under his proper name and
designation: <i>Serveto Hispano neganti Christum esse Dei
Filium, consubstantialem Patri</i>&mdash;To Servetus the Spaniard,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
denying that Christ is the Son of God, consubstantial with
the Father. Melanchthon also speaks of him in some passages
of his writings. But methinks you have really warrant
enough in what is already sent you to dive deeper into the
matter, and to put him on his trial. As to the printers of the
book, I did not send you the table of contents as any proof
that Balthasar Arnoullet and William Geroult, his brother-in-law,
were the parties; but of the fact that they were so we
are well assured, nor indeed will it be possible for them to
deny it. The printing was probably done at the author’s expense,
and he may have taken the impression into his own
keeping; he must have done so, indeed, if you find it has left
the premises of the persons named. I rather think I omitted
to say that when you have done with the epistles, I beg you
will be good enough to return them to me. And now, commending
myself to your good grace, and praying God so to
guide you that you may do all that is agreeable in his sight,</p>

<p class="author">
I am yours, &amp;c.,<br />
<span class="smcap">Guillaume Trie</span>.</p>

<p>Geneva, this last day of March, 1553.</p></blockquote>

<p>It must still be needless to say that neither is this
any letter of young Trie. What could he have
known of the printed works of Michael Serveto, alias
Rev&eacute;s, or of his being condemned by the Churches of
Germany&mdash;which by the way he never was&mdash;or of his
expulsion from that country&mdash;which is also against the
fact? What intimation could he have had that Œcolampadius
had written to Servetus, the Spaniard, combating
his heresies and that Melanchthon had mentioned
him in sundry passages of his work, the ‘Loci communes’?
Calvin, on the other hand, was not only well
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
informed of much that had happened to Michael Servetus
from the date of their meeting in Paris in 1534,
even to the hour in which he was now writing by the
hand of William Trie, but was himself the author of
some of the statements put into the mouth of that
worthy.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a>

<p class="hang">ARREST OF SERVETUS AND ARNOULLET, THE PUBLISHER.&mdash;THE
TRIAL FOR HERESY AT VIENNE&mdash;SERVETUS IS
SUFFERED TO ESCAPE FROM PRISON.</p>

<p>April 4. After the receipt of Trie’s third epistle, a
solemn council was convened within the Archiepiscopal
Ch&acirc;teau of Roussillon, at which were present the
Cardinal Tournon, the Archbishop of Vienne, the two
Grand Vicars, the Inquisitor Ory, and many Ecclesiastics
and Doctors in Divinity. There and then the
letters of Trie, the printed leaves of the ‘Christianismi
Restitutio,’ and more than twenty epistles addressed to
John Calvin, were examined with every care and attention,
all being reported the work of Michael Servetus,
alias Rev&eacute;s, living at Vienne under the assumed name
of Michel Villeneuve. The documents being held of
the most seriously compromising character, the Cardinal
Archbishop of Lyons and the Archbishop of Vienne,
with the concurrence of the whole assembly, now gave
orders for the arrest of Michel Villeneuve, Physician,
and Balthasar Arnoullet, bookseller, to answer for their
faith on certain charges and informations to be laid
against them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span></p>

<p>The Archbishop of Vienne returned home in the
afternoon in company with his Grand Vicar, Arzelier,
and having summoned the Vibailly de la Cour to the
Palace, informed him of the resolutions come to and
the pleasure of the Cardinal. In order that nothing
might transpire, and no understanding be come to
between the parties incriminated, the Vicar and Vibailly
agreed so to arrange matters that Villeneuve and
Arnoullet should be arrested at the same moment, but
imprisoned separately. The Vibailly accordingly proceeded
to the house of Arnoullet, and having sent in a
message desiring him to bring a copy of the New
Testament but just printed, Arnoullet was arrested on
the spot, and carried off to the Archiepiscopal prison.
Proceeding next to the house of M. de Maugiron, the
Lieutenant-Governor of Dauphiny, then indisposed,
and on whom it was known that Doctor Villeneuve
was in attendance, the Vibailly informed the Doctor
that there were several prisoners sick and some
wounded in the hospital of the royal prison who required
his services, as was indeed the case. Doctor
Villeneuve replied that independently of his profession
making it imperative on him immediately to obey such
a summons, he still took pleasure in being so usefully
employed. He therefore went at once; and whilst
engaged in his visit, the Vibailly sent requesting the
presence of the Grand Vicar. On his arrival Villeneuve
was informed that certain charges having been made
and informations laid against him, he must consent to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
hold himself a prisoner until he had given satisfactory
answers to the questions that would be put to him.
The gaoler, Anton Bonin, was then summoned and enjoined
to guard the prisoner strictly, but to treat him
respectfully, according to his quality. He was to be
allowed his personal attendant or valet, Beno&icirc;t Perrin,
a lad fifteen years of age, to wait on him; and his friends
were to have free access to him.</p>

<p>April 5. Archbishop Paumier now hastened to
inform Brother Ory, the inquisitor, that they had Villeneuve
in custody, and begged him to come immediately
to Vienne. Ory, like a vulture swooping on the carcass,
is said to have made such haste&mdash;<i>pressa tellement
sa monture</i>&mdash;that he arrived in an incredibly short
space of time at Vienne. As it was then about the hour
of the midday meal, however, the Archbishop and he,
thinking it well to recruit the inward man before entering
on the serious business they had on hand, sate
themselves quietly down to table and dined. The
cravings of nature satisfied, Arzelier the Vicar-General,
and De la Cour the Vibailly of Vienne, were summoned
to the Palace&mdash;the secular in aid of the spiritual arm&mdash;and
the party proceeded to the prison.</p>

<p>Having had Michel Villeneuve, sworn physician,
and now prisoner at their instance, brought before
them in the Criminal Court of the Palace, they proceeded
to question him on matters of which they
at the moment knew more than he, though we may
well believe his fears pointed in the true direction.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
Informing the prisoner, as a preliminary, that he was
bound to answer truthfully to the interrogatories put to
him, which he promised to do, he was then sworn on
the Gospels and asked his name, his age, his place of
birth, and his profession.</p>

<p>His name, he replied, was Michel Villeneuve,
doctor in medicine, forty-four years of age, and a
native of Tudela, in the kingdom of Navarre, residing
for the present, as he had done during the last twelve
years or thereabouts, at Vienne.</p>

<p>Asked where and in what places he had lived since
he left his native country; he said that some seven or
eight and twenty years ago, before the Emperor Charles
V. left Spain for Italy, in view of his coronation, he
had entered the service of brother John Quintana, the
Confessor of the Emperor, being then no more than
fifteen or sixteen years old; that he had gone to Italy
in the suite of the Emperor, and been present at his
coronation at Bologna. That he then accompanied
Quintana to Germany, in which country he resided for
about a year, when his patron died; since which time
he had lived without a master, first at Paris, having
had lodgings in the Coll&eacute;ge de Calvi, and then in the
Coll&eacute;ge des Lombards, engaged in the study of Mathematics.
From Paris he had gone to Lyons, and spent
some time between that city and Avignon, but had
finally settled at Charlieu, where, having lived practising
his profession, for about three years, he had finally
been induced by Messeigneurs the Archbishop of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
Vienne and the Archbishop of Maurice, to quit Charlieu
and establish himself at Vienne, in which city, as said,
he had lived since then to the present time.</p>

<p>Asked whether he had not had several books
printed for him? he replied that at Paris he had a book
printed, the title of which was: <i>Syruporum universa
ratio ad Galeni censuram disposita</i>&mdash;a treatise on Syrups
according to the principles of Galen; and a pamphlet
entitled: <i>In Leonartum Fussinum, Apologia pro Symphoriano
Campeggio</i>&mdash;an apologetic address to Leonard
Fuchs for Symphorian Campeccius. He had further
edited and annotated the ‘Geography of Ptolemy.’
Other than these, the works now named, he had written
none, nor had he had any others printed for him; but
he admitted that he had corrected the text of many
more, without adding to them anything of his own, or
taking from them anything of their writers.</p>

<p>Being now shown two sheets of paper, printed on
both sides and having marginal annotations in writing,
and admonished that the matter of the writing might
bring him into trouble, he was informed, further, that
he, if he were the writer, might be able to explain or to
say in what sense he understood what was there set
down. One of the propositions in the writing was
particularly pointed out to this effect: <i>Justificantur
ergo Parvuli sine Christi fide, prodigium, monstrum
d&aelig;monum!</i>&mdash;Infants therefore are justified without faith
in Christ, a prodigy, a portent of devils! and he was
informed that if he understood the words to say that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
infants had not by their regeneration [through baptism,
understood] received the perfect grace of Christ and
so were acquitted of Adam’s sin, this would be to
contemn Christ. He was therefore required to declare
how he understood the words. He replied that
he firmly believed that the grace of Christ, imparted
by baptism, overcame the sin of Adam, as St. Paul
declares (Rom. v.): ‘Where sin abounds there doth
grace more abound;’ and that infants are saved without
faith acquired, but through faith then infused by
the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>Having shown him how necessary it was that he
should alter several words in the written matter, he
promised to do so, saying however that he was not
prepared at a moment’s notice to say whether the
writing was his or not. It was very long, indeed, since
he had written anything. On examining the character
particularly, however, he now thinks it must be his.
In all that concerns the faith he yet begs to say that he
submits himself entirely to his holy mother the Church,
from whose teachings he has never wished to swerve.
If there be some things in the papers before the Court
open to objection, he believes he must have written
them inconsiderately, or only advanced them as subjects
for discussion. He then goes on to say that, having
now looked closely at the writing on the two leaves, he
acknowledges it as his, having the opportunity at the
same time of explaining the sense in which he would
have it understood. If there were anything else, he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
concluded, that was found objectionable or that savoured
of false doctrine, he was ready on having it pointed out
to him to alter and amend it. The two leaves paged
from 421 to 424, and treating of baptism,<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> were then
ordered to be marked by the clerk of the Court, and
with the other papers produced, to be taken under his
charge; after which the sitting was suspended.</p>

<p>April 6. Sworn as before upon the Gospels to
speak the truth (and from what we know and have
just seen feeling assured how indifferently he had
hitherto kept his word), Villeneuve was further interrogated
as follows: 1st. How he understands a proposition
in an epistle numbered xv., wherein the Living
Faith and the Dead Faith are treated of in terms that
seem perfectly Catholic, and wholly opposed to the
errors of Geneva, the words being these, <i>Mori autem
sensim dicitur in nobis Fides quando tolluntur vestimenta</i>&mdash;now
faith dies perceptibly in us when its vestments
are thrown off? To this he answered that he
believed the vestments of faith to be works of charity
and mercy. 2nd. Shown another epistle, numbered
xvi., on Free will, in opposition to those who hold that
the will is not free, he is asked how he understands
what is there said? With tears in his eyes he replies,
‘Sirs, these letters were written when I was in Germany,
now some five and twenty years ago, when there
was printed in that country a book by a certain Servetus,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
a Spaniard; but from what part of Spain I know
not, neither do I know in what part of Germany he
dwelt, though I have heard say that it was at Agnon
(Hagenau in Elsass), four leagues from Strasburg, that
the book in question was printed. Having read it
when I was very young&mdash;not more than fifteen or
sixteen&mdash;I thought that the writer said many things
that were good, that were better treated by him,
indeed, than by others.’ Quitting Germany for
France, without taking any books with him, Villeneuve
went on to say, that he had gone to Paris with a
view to study mathematics and medicine, and had
lived there, as already said, for some years. Whilst
residing there, having heard Monsieur Calvin spoken
of as a learned man, he had, out of curiosity, and without
knowing him personally, entered into correspondence
with him, but begged him to hold his letters as private
and confidential&mdash;<i>sub sigillo secreti</i>. ‘I, on my part,’
he proceeds, ‘seeking brotherly correction, as it were,
but saying that if he could not wean me from my
opinions or I wean him from his, I should not feel
myself bound to accept his conclusions. On which I
proposed certain weighty questions for discussion. He
replied to me shortly after, and seeing that my questions
were to the same effect as those discussed by Servetus,
he said that I must myself be Servetus. To this I answered
that, though I was not Servetus, nevertheless,
and that I might continue the discussion, I was content
for the time to personate Servetus, and should reply,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
as I believed he would have done, not caring for what
he might please to think of me, but only that we might
debate our views and opinions with freedom. With
this understanding we interchanged many letters, but
finally fell out, got angry, and began to abuse each other.
Matters having come to this pass, I ceased writing, and
for ten years or so I have neither heard from him nor
he from me. And here, gentlemen, I protest before
God and before you all, that I had no will to dogmatise,
or to substitute aught of mine that might be found
adverse to the Church or the Christian Religion.’</p>

<p>The prisoner being shown a third epistle numbered
xvii., on the Baptism of Infants, in which he says,
‘<i>Parvuli carnis non sunt capaces doni Spiritus</i>&mdash;Infants
as mere carnal beings are incapable of receiving
the gift of the Spirit,’&mdash;was desired to say in what
sense he meant these words to be taken. He answered
that he had formerly been of opinion that infants were
incompetent in the matter, as stated; but that he had
long given up such an opinion and now desired to
range himself with the teaching of the Church. Shown
a fourth epistle, numbered xviii., its heading or argument
being, ‘Of the Trinity, and the Generation of the
Son of God, according to Servetus,’ he acknowledged
it as having been written by him in the course of his
discussion with Calvin, when he was assuming the
part of Servetus; but as he had said of the former
letter, No. xvii., so he says of this, that he does not
now believe what is there set down, everything in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
letter having only been propounded to learn what
Calvin might have to advance in opposition to the
views set forth. A fifth letter, the burden of which is,
‘Of the glorified flesh of Christ absorbed in the Glory
of the Deity more fully than it was at the Transfiguration,’
being handed to him, he said that when he
addressed his correspondent on this subject, he felt
at greater liberty than usual to say all he thought of
it individually, and was now ready to answer any
question put to him bearing upon it. None, however,
were asked.</p>

<p>But the letters to Calvin were not yet done with.
A whole bundle of them, fourteen in number, was exhibited,
and the prisoner informed that the judges
found much matter there for which very particular
answers would be required. Having looked at the
letters, the prisoner said he saw that they were all
addressed to Calvin long ago, and with a view to learn
from him what he thought of the questions raised, as
already said. But he added that he was by no means
now disposed to abide by all he had written of old,
save and except in respect of such views as might be
approved by the Church and his Judges. He was
therefore ready to answer to each particular head on
which he might be interrogated. This the Judges proposed
to do at their next meeting, and meantime having
ordered a schedule of the principal points upon which
there appeared to be error against the faith to be drawn
up from the writings, all the documents being duly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
labelled and signed, the session was suspended until
the morrow.</p>

<p>Immediately after the second interrogatory to which
he was subjected, Servetus on his return to prison sent
his servant Perrin to the Monastery of St. Pierre to
ask the Grand Prior if he had received the 300 crowns
owing to him&mdash;Villeneuve by M. St. Andr&eacute;. The
money having been received, was remitted by the
hands of Perrin to his master. Had Servetus put off
his message to the Prior but for an hour, he would
have lost his money, the Inquisitor Ory having given
fresh orders to the gaoler to guard M. Villeneuve very
strictly, and to suffer him to see and have speech of
no one without his&mdash;the Inquisitor’s express permission.
Ory, we may presume, had not only no favour for
Servetus, but, with so much against him as already
appeared, could have had little doubt of bringing conviction
home to him and so having him sent in smoke
as an acceptable sacrifice to heaven. But Villeneuve
had friends among his other judges who were every
way disposed to aid him, if it were possible. Matters
certainly looked very black indeed: Michel Villeneuve
was plainly Michael Servetus of evil theological reputation;
flagrant heresy was already manifest in the documents
produced, and his answers to the interrogatories
were so little satisfactory that acquittal from the charges
laid against him, even at the outset of the process,
seemed out of the question. The judges, however,
were not all Brother Orys nor Cardinal Tournons,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
though most of them were churchmen, and, to their
honour, both tolerant and merciful in circumstances
where their creed prescribed intolerance and deadening
of the heart to pity. Servetus had however to be sent
back to his prison; but the door of the cage might be
left open and the bird allowed to fly. And everything
leads to the conclusion that this was exactly what was
done.</p>

<p>Connected with the prison there was a garden
having a raised terrace looking on to the court of the
palace of justice; and, abutting on the garden wall, a
shed, by the roof of which and a projecting buttress on
the other side a descent into the court-yard of the
palace could easily be made. The garden as a rule
was kept shut, but prisoners above the common in
station were permitted to use it for exercise and also
for occasions of nature. Having enjoyed this privilege
from the first, Servetus appears to have scrutinised
everything in the afternoon of April 6, after the conclusion
of his second examination. On the morning of the
seventh he rose at four o’clock and asked the gaoler,
whom he found afoot and going out to tend his vines,
for the key of the garden. The man, seeing his prisoner
in velvet cap and dressing-gown, not aware that he was
completely dressed and had his hat under his robe de
chambre, gave him the key and went out shortly afterwards
to his work. Servetus, on his part, when he thought
the coast must be clear, left his black velvet cap and
furred dressing-gown at the foot of a tree, leaped from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
the terrace on to the roof of the outhouse and from
that, without breaking any bones, gained the open
court of the Palais de Justice Dauphinal. Thence he
made for the gate of the Pont du Rh&ocirc;ne, which was at
no great distance from the prison and passed into the
Lyonnais&mdash;these latter facts being by and by deposed
to by a peasant woman who had met him. Two hours
or more elapsed before his escape became known in
the prison, the gaoler’s wife having been the first to
discover it. She in her zeal and alarm committed
a hundred extravagances; and in her vexation tore her
hair, beat her children, her servants, and some of the
prisoners who chanced to come in her way. Her rage
that anyone should have had the audacity to break the
dauphinal prison of Vienne, of which her husband was
custodier, was such, that she even ran the risk of her
life by clambering to the roof of a neighbouring house,
in her eagerness to find traces of the fugitive.</p>

<p>The authorities, informed of what had happened,
did all that became them, ordering the gates of the
town to be shut and more carefully guarded than usual
through the next few days and nights. Proclamation
was made by sound of trumpet and beat of drum, and
almost every house not only of the town, but of the
neighbouring villages, was visited. The magistrates of
Lyons and other towns, in which it was thought probable
their late prisoner might have taken refuge, were
written to by the Vienne authorities and inquiries made
whether or not he had money in the bank, or had drawn
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
out any he might have had there. His apartments
were again visited, and all his papers, furniture and
effects inventoried and put under the seal of justice.</p>

<p>In the town of Vienne it was generally thought
that the Vibailly De la Cour had been the active party
in favouring the evasion of Villeneuve. He was known
to be intimate with the doctor, who had lately carried
his daughter successfully through a long and dangerous
illness, and had been loud in praise of the skill and
devotion that had been shown with so happy a result.
Chorier,<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> the historian of Dauphiny, hints guardedly
at something of the kind when he speaks of the imprisonment
of M. Villeneuve on religious grounds. ‘It
fell out,’ says Chorier, ‘that by his own ingenuity and
the assistance of his friends, M. Villeneuve escaped
from confinement.’</p>

<p>In the record of proceedings after the flight the
only thing mentioned is the fact of the gaoler having
given the prisoner the key of the garden; on all else
there is absolute silence; whence, as D’Artigny says,
we may infer that there is mystery of some sort connected
with the escape. We, for our part, should
have no difficulty in finding a key to the mystery, had
there been fewer grounds for the presumption of
friendly connivance than there undoubtedly were in
the business. John Calvin, arch-heretic in the eyes of
the Gallic Church and its heads, could not, we must
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
presume, have been held in the highest possible esteem
by the Cardinal Archbishop of Lyons, to say nothing
of brother Mathias Ory, Inquisitor of the king of
France and all the Gauls. But the arrest of Villeneuve
and the proceedings against him thus far, had depended
entirely on information supplied by the Reformer of
Geneva.</p>

<p>The managers of the process against Servetus were
men much too astute, much too clear-sighted not to
see that it was John Calvin who was writing under
the mask of William Trie; and one among them at
least may have known that the state of feeling between
the Reformer of Geneva and the Physician of Vienne
had long been such that he of Geneva might not be
indisposed to make use of them to wreak his vengeance
against a personal enemy under the guise of a common
heretic. The Judges indeed must all have seen from
the letters of Villeneuve to Calvin that the two men
were at daggers-drawn, and that the provocation on
either part was neither new nor slight, but of long
standing, and, judging by his present attitude, on Calvin’s
side deadly. We can fancy brother Mathias
Ory chuckling over the sweet simplicity of the
Viennese mediciner’s sorry subterfuge in pretending to
enact the part of ‘Servetus the Spaniard, though he
was no such personage, and knew nothing of the place
in Spain where he was born!’</p>

<p>The authorities of Vienne, however, had no desire to
have their friend Villeneuve burned alive for heresy on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
testimony gratuitously supplied by the arch-heretic of
Geneva, and thereby give him, whom they hated and
feared far more than a thousand lay schismatics, a
triumph not only over an enemy, but over themselves,
for their lack of insight and zeal as guardians of the only
saving faith. And then, and in addition to all this, there
was Monseigneur Paumier to be considered&mdash;Paumier,
under whose patronage Villeneuve had settled at Vienne
and lived so long in the very shadow of the archiepiscopal
palace, on terms of intimacy with its distinguished occupant.
How should the great man escape suspicion
of heresy himself if it were known that he had been
living as a friend with one who held all the most holy
mysteries of the Roman Religion as mere vanities or
inventions of the Devil! The man had lived, it is true,
long and peaceably among them, respected in his life
and trusted in his calling; and if Calvin found heresy
and to spare in his writings against the tenets which he
as well as they held in common, they discovered outpourings
enough there against Predestination and Election
by the Grace of God, Effectual calling, Justification by
Faith, and the rest, that formed the groundwork of the
objectionable doctrines both of Luther and Calvin. If
M. the Vibailly De la Cour connived at the escape of
Villeneuve, and that he did there can hardly be a doubt,
we may be well assured that he acted with the concurrence
of his more immediate associates in the administration
of justice&mdash;lay and clerical. The Vibailly remained
unchallenged in his office; the gaoler was not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
dismissed, and Arnoullet the printer, for the present at
least, was set at liberty. Nothing of all this could
have happened had Justice not consented to be hoodwinked.
The gaoler’s wife, in fact, seems to have been
the only person in downright earnest in the business of
the escape.

<h2 id="BOOK_I_CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<p class="hang">DISCOVERY OF ARNOULLET’S PRIVATE PRINTING ESTABLISHMENT&mdash;SEIZURE
AND BURNING OF THE ‘CHRISTIANISMI
RESTITUTIO’ ALONG WITH THE EFFIGY OF
ITS AUTHOR.</p>

<p>The remainder of the month of April was spent in
making a renewed and more particular examination of
the books, papers, and letters of Villeneuve, and in
having copies made of the letters addressed to Calvin,
the originals of which were placed for safe custody
under the official seals. And here, if our surmises be
well founded: that the authorities of Vienne had really
no wish, on testimony supplied by Calvin, to convict
of heresy a man who had always comported himself as
a good Catholic and still professed himself a true son
of the Church, every way disposed to receive instruction
and bow to the decisions of those who must know
so much better than himself what was the true saving
faith&mdash;the matter would probably have ended, in so
far as those of Vienne were concerned. But Ory,
the Inquisitor, nowise anxious like the others to hush
up so promising an affair, had by some means been
informed in the beginning of the month of May that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
there had been a couple of presses kept at work away
from the proper printing establishment of Arnoullet.</p>

<p>Of this significant fact, no mention had been made
either by Villeneuve or Arnoullet on their examination,
and whence Ory had the intimation we are left
to conjecture. There seems hardly room for doubt,
however, that it reached him through the old channel,
viz., Arneys; that Arneys had the news he gave
to Ory from Trie, and that Trie had the tale he told
from Calvin. Frelon, as we have seen, must have
been in the secret of Servetus, and Frelon was also
the friend of Calvin; from Frelon alone could Calvin
have had the particular information he shows he possessed
concerning the terms on which the ‘Christianismi
Restitutio’ was printed; and it was only from
Calvin that Trie could have obtained intelligence of
the kind he communicates to his relative Arneys of
Lyons. The process against Servetus, as we know,
began from Lyons; and from Lyons was it now resuscitated.
But who living there was so likely to have
heard of a printing press worked privately at Vienne,
twelve miles away, as he who had all he knew about
the heretic Villeneuve from Geneva, and had been the
instrument in setting on foot the movement that was
now to proceed to more disastrous issues?</p>

<p>With the new and important hint but just received,
Ory sped off to Vienne from Lyons, his head-quarters;
and he may possibly have used even greater diligence
on this occasion than he did before when he is said to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
have spurred his steed so vigorously. Summoning
the Vibailly and Grand Vicar to his side, the three
proceeded immediately to the premises that had been
indicated as the private printing place of the publisher
Arnoullet; and entering, sure enough, they found three
compositors at work, Straton, Du Bois, and Papillon
by name. It is not difficult to imagine the terror of
these men at the sight of such visitors. Before proceeding
to interrogate them severally, the Inquisitor
took care to address them generally on the enormity
of the crime of which he assumed they had been guilty,
and to say that they deserved the severest punishment
for having withheld the important information they
could have supplied. When proceedings were commenced
against their master and M. Villeneuve, he
said, they must be aware that it had been specially enjoined
upon all and sundry, under pain of being dealt
with as heretics, to communicate whatever they knew
about the book, which he declared they must have
known to be written by Villeneuve and printed by their
master Arnoullet. Stretching a point, as we may imagine,
he told the men further, that he had proofs in his
hands that they were the very parties who had worked
at the composition and printing of the book in question.
He now, therefore, exhorted them to speak the truth
and to ask pardon if they had been guilty or hoped
for favour, the authorities he added, indeed, intending
correction, not punishment.</p>

<p>The workmen, terribly alarmed, fell as with one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
accord upon their knees, and Straton, speaking for
himself and the others, owned that they had printed
an octavo volume entitled ‘Christianismi Restitutio,’
but were not aware that it contained heretical doctrines,
being ignorant of the Latin language in which it was
written, and never having heard that it did, until after
the prosecution had been set on foot. He informed
his questioner further that he and his associates had
been steadily engaged on the book from the feast of St.
Michael to January 3 last&mdash;over three months&mdash;when
the printing was completed; yet more, that they had
not dared to give information of their part in the
business for fear of being burned alive; and to conclude,
they now sought forgiveness, and threw themselves
on the mercy of the authorities. More particularly
questioned, Straton said that Michel de Villeneuve
had had the book in question printed at his own
expense, and had corrected the proofs in person. To
end the tale, and he may have thought to make amends
for his past silence, he said further that on January 13
he had despatched five bales of the book to the care of
Pierre Merrin, typefounder, of Lyons.</p>

<p>Delighted with the great discovery just made, inasmuch
as they would now have grounds of their own to
proceed upon, the three associates hastened to communicate
the information they had acquired to the
Archbishop of Vienne, who in turn imparted it to
Cardinal Tournon. Next day the Inquisitor Ory and
the Grand Vicar Arzelier set off for Lyons. Proceeding
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
at once to the establishment of Pierre Merrin, they
questioned him as to what he knew of the business, and
particularly about certain bales, five in number, that
had lately come into his possession and were believed
to contain heretical books. Merrin, having no motive
for concealment, informed his visitors that about four
months back he had received by the canal boat of
Vienne five bales with the following address: From
M. Michel de Villeneuve, doctor in medicine, these five
bales, to be delivered to Pierre Merrin, typefounder,
near Notre Dame de Confort, Lyons. On the day
the bales were received, he added, a priest of Vienne,
Jacques Charmier by name, had come to him and
requested him to keep the bales until called for, saying
that they contained nothing but printing-paper. From
the time named, however, he had heard nothing from
the sender, neither had anyone called to enquire after
the bales or to take them away; and for his part he
knew not whether they contained white paper for
printing as said, or printed books as now alleged.</p>

<p>Having finished their interrogatory and seen the
bales, the Inquisitor and Vicar made no scruple about
seizing them in the name of the public authorities.
Carrying them off at once, they were taken to Vienne
and deposited in a room of the Archiepiscopal palace.</p>

<p>The priest Charmier was of course the next person
visited and questioned. He persistently denied all
knowledge of the contents of the bales which he, as he
was proceeding to Lyons, recommended to the care of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
Merrin, at the request of M. Villeneuve. The mere
act of the poor priest, however, and his known intimacy
with Villeneuve, were held to have compromised him
to such an extent that he was put on his trial some
time afterwards, and sentenced to imprisonment for
three years!</p>

<p>The bales once safe in the Archiepiscopal palace
of Vienne, were speedily undone, and there, sure
enough, as Straton had said, five hundred copies of the
‘Christianismi Restitutio,’ complete, were displayed to
the eager eyes of the lookers-on. A single copy was
abstracted and given to Ory, to enable him at his
leisure to extract and take exception to such passages
as he might deem heretical; the rest were left in safe
custody under the palace roof.</p>

<p>Every information up to June 17&mdash;for so long had
it taken to get at the facts as they have been stated&mdash;having
now been acquired, and the proofs in the
process being held complete, the Vibailly of Vienne,
in a session of the Court duly summoned, and in the
absence of Michel de Villeneuve, proceeded to pass
sentence on him, finding him attainted and convicted
of the crimes and misdemeanours laid to his charge,
viz., Scandalous Heresy and Dogmatisation; Invention
of New Doctrines; Writing heretical books; Disturbance
of the public peace; Rebellion against the
King; Disobedience of the ordinances touching heresy,
and Breach of the Royal Prison of Vienne. ‘For reparation
of the crimes and misdeeds set forth,’ said the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
Judge, ‘we condemn him, and he is hereby condemned,
to pay a fine of 1000 livres Tournois to the King of
Dauphiny; and further, as soon as he can be apprehended,
to be taken, together with his books, on a
tumbril or dust-cart to the place of public execution,
and there burned alive by a slow fire until his body is
reduced to ashes.’ The sentence now delivered, moreover,
is ordered to be carried out forthwith on an effigy
of the incriminated Villeneuve, which is to be publicly
burned along with the five bales of the book in question,
the fugitive being further condemned to pay the
charges of justice, his goods and chattels being seized
and confiscated, to the advantage of anyone showing
just claims to the proceeds, the fine and expenses of the
trial, as aforesaid, having been first duly discharged.</p>

<p>On the same day about noon the effigy of
Villeneuve, made by the executioner of the High Court
of Justice, having been put upon a tumbril along with
the bales of the book, was paraded through the streets
of Vienne, brought to the place of public execution,
hanged upon a gibbet erected for the purpose, and
finally set fire to, and with the five bales burned to ashes.</p>

<p>The matter, however, did not rest here; it was not
yet concluded in all its parts. The secular arm had
done what was required of it, having burned the
criminal in effigy, failing his person, along with his
heretical book; but the ecclesiastical authorities must
also have their say in the case. When the utterance
came, and it came not until six months after the civil
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
trial and sham execution, it was in every particular
confirmatory of the sentence already delivered, the
grounds of the decision however being gone into with
greater minuteness than before. Among other matters
particularly mentioned now, are the marginal notes in
the handwriting of the culprit on two printed leaves,
cut out of a copy of Calvin’s ‘Institutions;’ Seventeen
letters addressed to John Calvin and acknowledged by
Villeneuve to be from him; his answers to the Inquisitor
Ory, the Vibailly, and the rest, and the minutes
which had been made of his escape from the prison;
finally, his books, one entitled ‘Christianismi Restitutio,’
and another in two parts: ‘De Trinitatis Erroribus,
Libri septem,’ and ‘De Trinitate, Dialogi duo.’ ‘From
all that has been brought to light,’ the judgment proceeds,
‘it is made manifest that the said Villeneuve is a
most egregious heretic, and as such is hereby adjudged,
convicted and condemned, his body to be burned, and
his goods to be confiscated, the judicial expenses incurred
and yet to be incurred to be defrayed out of the
proceeds of the sale.’ All the books written by Villeneuve
are further ordered to be diligently searched for,
and wherever found, to be seized and burned.</p>

<p>It is not unimportant to notice that Arnoullet, the
publisher and printer, is associated with Servetus in
this ecclesiastical judgment. ‘The said Villeneuve and
Balthazar Arnoullet are attainted and to be held conjoined
in the sentence because of their complicity and
connection.’ Arnoullet however was more mercifully
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
dealt with than Villeneuve; he was not condemned to
be burned alive; neither did he suffer imprisonment
for any great length of time, but was by and by set at
liberty on giving security for his good behaviour in
future. If Charmier, the priest, was sentenced to incarceration
for three years, having, as far as we know,
done nothing more than deliver a message from Villeneuve
to Merrin the type-founder, we might have
imagined that Arnoullet would scarcely have escaped
with so little scath; for to have aided and abetted in
the printing of such a book as that entitled the ‘Restoration
of Christianity,’ which impugned the system
that placed the whole of his judges&mdash;Cardinal Tournon,
Archbishop Paumier, Ory, Arzelier, and the rest&mdash;in
positions of affluence and influence, could only have
been looked upon as a crime little less heinous than
that of which the author of the book himself had been
guilty. But Charmier was known to have been on
friendly terms with Villeneuve; and Paumier may have
guessed what that implied; for let us not forget that
all we speak of came to pass shortly after Giovanni de
Medici, under the title of Leo X., had been Pope; and
that if the Reformation had more well-wishers in France
than dared to proclaim themselves, Scepticism too, and
of the deepest dye, was at the same time rife in high
places. The poor priest Charmier, however, being of
the rank and file only, must pay for having meddled;
but let us hope that Archbishop Paumier interfered in
due season and succeeded in greatly abridging the
term of his imprisonment.

<h2 id="BOOK_II_CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="center">SERVETUS REACHES GENEVA&mdash;DETAINED THERE, HE IS
ARRESTED AT THE INSTANCE OF CALVIN.</p>

<p>Escaped from the Dauphinal prison of Vienne, Servetus
must, in all likelihood, have found hiding at first
with friends in Lyons. But there, as indeed anywhere
else in France, his life was in imminent danger; so
that for his own sake, as well as that of his friends,
terribly compromised by his presence, he had to seek
safety at a distance&mdash;even in another country. Nor
was it present safety only that was in question: the
means of living in time to come had further to be
thought of. But master of a profession that is welcome
everywhere, he may have had little anxiety on
that score; and he who had lived so long unmolested
as Villeneuve or Villanovanus, after compromising
himself as Serveto, alias Rev&eacute;s, would have been at no
loss to find another name to shield him from recognition.
His first thoughts carried him in the direction of Spain,
but he found so many difficulties from the French
gendarmerie, that he turned back; believing then that
the best course he could follow would be to betake
himself to Naples, where he knew there was a large
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
settled population of his own countrymen, among
whom he would find a sufficient field for the exercise
of his calling.</p>

<p>Calvin&mdash;erroneously beyond question&mdash;speaks of
Servetus having wandered for four months in Italy
after his escape from the prison of Vienne. Had he
reached Italian ground at this time, he would not have
returned upon Geneva, and then&mdash;presuming that he
escaped Calvin’s further pursuit&mdash;he might have lived,
usefully engaged, to a good old age, and died quietly
in his bed. Servetus arrived in Switzerland from the
side of France, and must have been in hiding in that
country, or wandering about in disguise from place to
place between April 7, the date of his evasion from
Vienne, and the middle of July when he reached
Geneva. The hue and cry from Vienne was probably
not of a kind to be heard afar; they who left the
prison door open may have seen to that&mdash;Servetus
indeed says himself that they did. It was not such,
at all events, as to prevent his baffling pursuit and escaping
recognition: for he entered Geneva in safety;
and feeling the soil of a state beneath his feet where
other than Roman Catholic views of religion prevailed,
he could hardly have thought that he would suffer
molestation did he but keep quiet during the day or
two he meant to remain in order to rest and recruit.</p>

<p>The experience Servetus had had so lately must
have satisfied him that he could hope for nothing from
the forbearance of Calvin; but he did not mean to put
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
this to the test: his business was to make no noise, and
to be gone as quickly as possible. Though he had
made the latter part of his journey on horseback, the
usual mode of locomotion in those days, he even
deemed it prudent, as less likely to attract attention,
to enter Geneva on foot. He therefore discharged his
steed at Louyset, a village a few miles distant, where
he passed the night, and reached the city in the early
morning of some day after the middle of July, 1553.
Putting up at a small hostelry on the banks of the lake,
having the sign of the Rose, he appears to have lain
there privily and unchallenged for nearly a month.</p>

<p>What could have induced Servetus to linger in a
place where we see, from the precautions he took both
in arriving and subsequently, that he could not have
thought himself safe, long remained a mystery; but
is cleared up in a great measure by the information we
obtain through the particulars of the trial to which he
was immediately subjected, and of which it is only of
late years that a full and entirely satisfactory account
has been obtained. We were disposed, at one time, to
ascribe the delay in setting out for Italy to the fascination
which the strong have over the weak, and to
imagine that our wanderer was still anxious for the
personal interview with Calvin he had formerly sought,
but been forced to forego, in Paris, and for which, as
we learn by the letter of Calvin to his friend Farel, he
had made fresh proposals at a later date.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> He was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
now aware, however, that it was by Calvin he had been
denounced to the authorities of Lyons and Vienne,
arrested in consequence, put upon his trial, and only
saved his life by escaping from prison. He could not
possibly, therefore, have flattered himself that the man
who was so disposed towards him would receive him
in any friendly mood; though it probably never came
into his mind to imagine that the Reformer would be
disposed to take the knife in hand himself.</p>

<p>As we now read the tale, we perceive that Servetus’s
presence in Geneva could not have been unknown
to all in the city, even from the day of his arrival; and
our persuasion is, that for some time at least he was kept
there against his will. On his trial we find him stating,
incidentally, that the windows of the room he occupied
at the Rose <i>had been nailed up!</i> What interpretation
can possibly be put on this? The nailing up could not
have been done to keep anyone <i>out</i> of a place of public
entertainment. It was therefore to keep someone <i>in</i>.
Servetus must in fact have been anxious from the first
to be gone; but he was detained by certain parties in
Geneva, not among the number of Calvin’s friends,
who thought to make political capital out of his presence
among them.</p>

<p>Nor were it hard to imagine that he, smarting as he
then was under the sense of all that had but just befallen
him through the interference of the Reformer, and
listening for the moment to the influential persons who
promised him support, and possibly redress, was not altogether
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
indisposed to pay his enemy back for the irreparable
injury he had suffered at his hands. But there is
nothing in all we know of Michael Servetus that leads
us for a moment to think of him as a revengeful man;
and though he may have lent an ear for a while to the
suggestions of his new friends, he must soon have
come to conceive misgivings as to the real meaning of
their attentions.</p>

<p>Even whilst lying hidden in his inn he could hardly
have failed, after a while, to learn something of the state
of political partisanship prevalent in the theocratic
republican city of Geneva, and so have been more than
ever anxious to be gone. Hence the nailing up of his
chamber windows. On Sunday, August 13, he had
even spoken to the landlord of the ‘Rose’ to procure
him a boat for the morrow, to take him by the Lake as
far as possible on his way to Z&uuml;rich. But his resolution
to delay his departure no longer was taken too
late. Weary of confinement, and always piously disposed,
he ventured imprudently to show himself at the
evening service of a neighbouring church; and being
there recognised, intimation of his presence in Geneva
was conveyed to Calvin, who, without loss of a moment,
and in spite of the sacredness of the day, denounced
him to one of the Syndics, and demanded his immediate
arrest.</p>

<p>To effect this in the city of Geneva of the year of
grace 1553 was no matter of difficulty, little being
made in those days of seizing on the person, and not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
much of taking the life. The accredited officer, armed
with a warrant, found Servetus in his inn; informed
him he was to consider himself a prisoner; led him
away, and threw him into the common jail of the
town.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span></p>

<h2 id="BOOK_II_CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="center">GENEVA AND THE STATE OF POLITICAL PARTIES AT
THE DATE OF SERVETUS’S ARREST.</p>

<p>‘The year 1553,’ says Beza, in his life of Calvin, ‘by
the impatience and fury of the factious, was a year so
full of trouble that not only was the Church, but the
Republic of Geneva, within a hair’s breadth of being
wrecked and lost; all power had fallen into the hands
of the wicked (i.e., the patriotic party of freethought,
opposed to Calvin, and designated the Libertines), that
it seemed as though they were on the point of attaining
the ends for which they had so long been striving.’
Eighteen years had then elapsed since the Reformation
first found footing in Geneva, and twelve since Calvin
had resumed his position&mdash;interrupted during a period
of two years&mdash;as a sort of spiritual dictator&mdash;‘the
Lycurgus of a Christian Democracy’&mdash;not only as Organiser
of the Faith, and Minister in the Church, but
as regulator and supervisor of the morals and manners
of the people.</p>

<p>The Reformation, in so far as Geneva was concerned,
seems to have been hailed on political much
more than on religious grounds. Emancipation from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
the yoke of the Roman Catholic bishop, under which
its citizens had long fretted, meant escape from the
political machinations, through the Priest, of France on
the one hand, of Savoy on the other. The change
from Romanism to Protestantism appears to have been
due, in fact, to no particular discontent of the Genevese
with the old Popish forms, or to any zeal for the
new doctrines of Luther and his followers, but to a
cherished hope of being suffered to pass their lives with
as little control as might be from authority of any kind,
and that little imposed and administered by themselves.</p>

<p>Moral discipline was notoriously lax over Europe
in the early years of the sixteenth century, nowhere
perhaps more so than at Geneva; and the liberty after
which its people sighed was often understood as license
rather than as life within the limits of moral law.
Accident, however, having brought John Calvin, already
a man of mark, to Geneva in the course of the year
1536, he was seized upon by William Farel, then in
principal charge of the spiritual concerns of the city,
and yielding to his most urgent entreaties&mdash;conjured,
indeed, in the name of God, to remain and aid in
the work of the Reformation&mdash;Calvin consented to
cast in his lot with the Genevese, still jubilant over
their lately recovered liberties and little amenable to
discipline of any kind.</p>

<p>A more unlikely conjunction of elements can hardly
be conceived than that of the ascetic, gloomy Calvin
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
with the lively, self-indulgent Genevese, to whom life
meant present enjoyment, and religion a pleasant addition
to existence on festivals and Sundays, to be put off
and on with their holiday garments and less to be
thought of than the next excursion to the mountains
in summer, or the approaching assembly for merriment
and the dance in winter.</p>

<p>To Calvin life and its import wore a totally different
aspect. To him the present was but a prelude to the
future, a discipline preparing for eternity, and religion
therefore the great end and aim of existence. Anchorite
himself in the truest sense of the word, he
would possibly have had herbs the food, the crystal
spring the drink of the community. Fatalist too to a
great extent through his doctrine of election and predestination,
the joys of life&mdash;if life perchance had any joys&mdash;and
its trials&mdash;and they were many, were to be taken
with like passiveness and equanimity. Even the inclemencies
of the seasons, as dispensations of providence,
were not to be over-anxiously guarded against: the
school-house windows, it is true, were to be glazed or
protected in some sort by diaphanous skins or horn;
but this was to be no higher than their lower halves;
and in so much only that the snow-drift, the wind and
the rain might not interfere with the work of the
scholars.</p>

<p>Conscious himself, through natural endowment and
added learning, of superiority to all about him, Calvin
had little or no sympathy with the liberty the Genevese
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
were so proud of having achieved. A despotism was
his ideal of civil government; and his proclaimed
purpose from the first in settling at Geneva was to
make the city a stronghold of the Gospel, its people
subjects of the Lord, and their faith and morals a model
of all that had been proposed by the Reformation in
the sense in which he understood it. And how much
he differed in this from Luther, and Zwingli, need not
be said. The</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Wer liebt nicht Weiber, Wein und Gesang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ein Narr ist er und bleibts sein Lebenslang<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>of him of the Wartburg, must have sounded as simple
profanity to Calvin.</p>

<p>That Calvin’s heavy hand was borne with by the
Genevese for two years, in the first instance, with no
small amount of discontent, indeed, but with no outbreak
of rebellion, must be set down, we imagine, to
the credit of human nature, which endures for a season
the irksome and even the ill, in hope of the good to
follow; but when the pressure is crushing, and there
is no prospect of alleviation, resistance, inevitably,
follows in the end.</p>

<p>Calvin and the special Court he had inaugurated
under the title of the Consistory, had been anxious to
impose some new and still more stringent ordinance on
the city, but the Council, whose sanction was required
before any of the consistorial edicts could have way,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
refused assent, and the citizens, emboldened by this,
forthwith appeared in open rebellion against what they
rightly construed as the tyranny and self-assertion of
the clergy. So unpopular in fact did the whole clerical
party become at this time, that its leader and his colleague
Farel were formally banished from the city, and
the subordinate ministers had to shrink into something
like obscurity if they would escape the necessity of accompanying
them.</p>

<p>In sore displeasure with the ungrateful conduct of
the people, as he regarded it, Calvin sought shelter
first in Basle and then in Strasburg, where he was
welcomed by his brother Reformers, and by and by
provided with honourable means of subsistence, by an
appointment as Professor of Theology in the University.</p>

<p>But he was not destined long to enjoy the leisure
of the Professor’s chair. Before two years had elapsed,
the more moderate, orderly, and pious party had come
again into power in Geneva, and he was waited on by
a deputation, headed by Amied Perrin, a man of the
highest influence among his fellow citizens, and entreated
to return and save them from themselves;
orderly existence, not otherwise attainable as it seemed,
being seen after all to be not too dearly bought even
by heavy payments in the shape of subserviency to
theocratic rule.</p>

<p>Calvin returned to Geneva, then, and under circumstances
that gave him a great advantage over the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
difficulties he had formerly encountered in carrying
into effect the system of discipline he was bent on introducing.
Perrin’s appearance at the head of the deputation
to Strasburg, he had seen as an omen of the
best augury; for Perrin’s influence in the Civic Council
was very great, and his approval of any measure proposed,
was taken as a sufficient guarantee by the citizens
at large, of its value. But Perrin was ambitious,
and certainly reckoned without his host when he hoped
by patronising John Calvin to make him in any way
the instrument of his own selfish or party designs;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Two stars keep not their orbit in one sphere;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>and if Perrin was bent on power, so was Calvin.</p>

<p>Perrin, it may be, had never heartily sympathised
with the Reformation in its religious aspects; he certainly
sympathised still less with the Reformer. A
man of pleasure at heart, he was perhaps somewhat
indifferent to religion. Ready enough to abet Calvin in
his austerities towards the many, he was minded to
keep his own neck and the necks of his friends out of
the yoke. Calvin, however, had no idea of anything
of the kind: his law was of general application, or it
had no significance; his rule was <i>one</i> and it was for all.
No wonder, therefore, that Perrin’s league with the
Reformer came to an end ere long; and that when it
was not open dissidence between them, it was always
smouldering enmity.</p>

<p>Calvin’s grand instrument in enforcing his discipline
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
was the Consistory, an assembly made up of the entire
acting clergy of Geneva, with a limited number&mdash;no
more than twelve&mdash;of the laity added. This body was
entrusted with very extensive powers, which it may be
imagined were not suffered to lie idle, when we find it
pretending to regulate the head, and even the foot,
gear of the women; intruding itself into the dwellings
of the people, too, and looking into their saucepans and
pint pots to see that there was no indulgence in the way
of eating and drinking!</p>

<p>Supported by a certain number of the native
Genevese, Calvin’s hands were immensely strengthened
by the crowd of refugees for conscience sake who
poured into Geneva from France and Italy, to escape
the persecution that had already begun to rage in
these countries. Henry II. of France, having presented
his mistress, Diana of Poitiers, with the proceeds
of all confiscations for heresy, her agents were
indefatigable in hunting out converts to the doctrines
of Luther and bringing them to justice, as it was called:
the greater the number of heretics burned, the higher
rose the fame for piety of the profligate king, and in
like measure the revenue of the heartless courtesan.</p>

<p>The refugees as a rule, and almost as a matter of
necessity, were entirely devoted to the Reformer; and
having been most liberally met by the Genevese at
first, and put on a footing of all but perfect political
equality, they made themselves felt, through their
numbers, in the frequently recurring elections that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
formed elements in the Genevese Republican system.
Favoured in all by Calvin, the strangers, as they increased
in numbers, came at length to be ever more
and more disliked and distrusted by the native population;
so that Calvin may be found using language
such as this, when, speaking in the same breath of the
fugitives, his friends, and of the people who sheltered
both him and them within their walls:&mdash;‘They (the
Genevese) are dissatisfied with you (the Refugees),
because you run not riot with them in their disorderly
and barren lives.’ The native population, in a word,
found themselves, ere long, controlled and overcrowed
by a host of aliens, led by a bigoted and intolerant ecclesiastic&mdash;a
state of things never to be patiently endured,
but to be ended at the first favourable moment; and
it is to the culminating dissatisfaction of the Genevese
with clerical rule in 1553, much akin to that of the
year 1538, when Calvin had been forced to quit the
field, that Beza refers in the passage quoted above.</p>

<p>So unpopular had Calvin again become in the year
1553, that, in writing to one of his friends, he speaks of
discontent and distrust as universally prevalent, especially
among the more youthful of the population. ‘The
accumulated rancour of their hearts,’ he says, ‘breaks
out from time to time; so that when I show myself in
the street, the curs are hounded on me: hiss! hiss! is
shouted to them; and they snap at my legs and tear my
clothes.’ Calvin must in truth have had a trying time
of it during most of the years he lived among the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
Genevese; his own bed could as little have been of
roses without thorns, as he suffered the beds of the
citizens to be of down; for, save during brief lulls, he
and they seem to have passed their lives in a state of
covert, when it was not one of open, warfare.</p>

<p>One of the earlier hostile moves of the civil Council
in the present crisis against the Reformer was the
exclusion, from the Greater Council of the State, of
some members of the Minor Council, known to be
among the number of his adherents. More than this,
his enemies having come to outnumber his friends in
the lately elected Council, he found himself frequently
outvoted in directions in which he had been used to
think of his wish or his will as already the law. Among
those who had now obtained a seat in the Supreme
Council, was one whom he had put under the consistorial
ban for some infringement of discipline, and forbidden,
until he showed signs of amendment, to present
his child for baptism. To choose Councillors from
among persons such as this, however, was, in Calvin’s
eyes, to fly in the face not only of all authority, but of
the Almighty himself.</p>

<p>Another move against him was a resolution taken
by the Council to deprive the Refugees of the arms
with which they, like the native population, had been
entrusted at an earlier period for the common defence.
This was taken greatly to heart by Calvin, who stigmatised
it as a ‘barbarous and brutal act, perpetrated
by enemies of the Gospel against exiles for Christ’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
sake.’ But the Council did not stop here in showing
its hostile mood. The priests, in the olden time, had
been privileged like the rest of the Community to be
present at the deliberations of the Council, and the
Ministers, their successors, had never been challenged
in their title to show themselves as auditors in the same
way. They were now, however, by a resolution of the
Council, declared incompetent to appear at its sittings
without special permission given. Of no great moment
in itself or politically considered, this interdict pointed
with even needless significance to mislike and mistrust
of the clergy as a body, and of their distinguished head
in particular&mdash;the Council would neither have him nor
his followers immediately informed of all the business
they had in hand.</p>

<p>How keenly all these proceedings were felt by
Calvin is apparent from the tone of the letters he wrote
to more than one of his friends at this time. To his
friend Sulzer, of Basle, he says that for the last two
years they pass their lives at Geneva as if they were
living amid the declared enemies of the Gospel! and
he complains bitterly of the interference he suffers in
the exercise of his multifarious functions.</p>

<p>Among the particular incidents that tended to widen
the breach between Calvin with the ecclesiastical party
behind him, and the civil authorities backed by the
more liberally disposed of the citizens, was the case of
Philibert Berthelier, one of the Councillors, a man of
note, respected and much looked up to by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
Genevese; for he was the son of that Philibert Berthelier
who had nobly striven for the liberties of the city,
in former years, and gone to his death on the scaffold
in their assertion. Berthelier, some eighteen months
or so before, for an offence against one or other of the
arbitrary ordinances of the Consistory&mdash;for having
gone to a ball with his wife and daughter, we think,
they having further exceeded in the matter of dress&mdash;had
fallen under the interdict of the Ministers, and been
forbidden to present himself at the celebration of the
Lord’s supper, until he had made submission and promised
amendment.</p>

<p>Now Berthelier was not only a man of weight in
the Republic politically, but in the opinion of his fellow
citizens, of really irreproachable life and conversation;
and, his friends being then in power, he took steps to
have the interdict removed, which kept him from gratifying
his pious feelings by partaking of the commemorative
feast. To this end he presented a petition
to the Council, setting forth the grievance under which
he laboured, and praying for relief; and they, on their
part, took it on them forthwith not only to absolve him
of the disability of which he complained, but, proceeding
a step farther, they declared the Consistory incompetent
in time to come to pronounce sentences of
Excommunication at all; transferring the right to do
so from the Ecclesiastical Assembly to the Minor
Council of the State.</p>

<p>This was felt by Calvin as the heaviest blow that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
had yet been dealt him. Of course he opposed the
measure with all his might. Heard in opposition to
its adoption, he declared that if it were maintained
the very foundations of the Reformation, in so far as
Religion was concerned, would be compromised. But
all his eloquence was thrown away; after long and
eager discussion the decree was finally confirmed.
Disgusted with the opposition he encountered at every
point, Calvin&mdash;though he soon shows that he is anxious
to free himself from any suspicion of the kind&mdash;appears
at the time to have had serious thoughts of throwing up
his charge and abandoning the city of Geneva to its own
evil devices. It was probably the consciousness that if
he left Geneva he would seem to be turning his back
on the whole of the Reform movement, which kept him
from taking the extreme step he may probably have
meditated. He had become accustomed, moreover, to
play the despot, and he who has once indulged in the
bitter sweets of arbitrary power scarcely retires otherwise
than by compulsion into the shade of private life.
And then, whither was he to betake himself? Not to
France, though he still looked with longing eyes
towards his native country; for open heresy, such as
he must have felt himself bound to profess, there led
inevitably to the stake; neither to Germany, where his
own peculiar views were not popular, and the several
centres of the great and glorious movement towards
light and freedom, brought to a head by Luther, were
all adequately occupied. He must stay at Geneva,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
then, his ‘coign of vantage;’ abide the storm of the
present, and hope for better days to come. But it was
in bitterness of heart, waiting till reaction had spent
itself, and his voice could again be heard as the voice
of authority.</p>

<p>It was at this moment precisely, whilst debate and
dispute, ecclesiastical and civil, were at their height,
that Michael Servetus reached Geneva, and altogether
unwittingly and unwillingly on his part became a
subject of contention between the party of free thought,
now in open rebellion against Calvin and the more
rigid of his blind or compliant followers. And we shall
possibly see reason to conclude that Servetus, though
tried for heresy and finally condemned and done to
death by slow fire for blasphemy against God, was in
some measure also the victim of the political situation&mdash;the
scape-goat of the two parties contending for
supremacy in Geneva. Had there been less of political
rancour there in the year 1553, and Servetus been
allowed competent counsel to defend him, it seems to
us, on the most careful consideration of the whole
subject, that the proceedings would not have been
suffered to take the turn they did, which led inevitably
to his condemnation to death, whilst the memory of
Calvin would have escaped the portentous blot that
goes so far to obscure all the other great qualities that
attach to his name. The world might then have had
triumphs within the domain of physical science other
than the discovery of the lesser circulation of the blood,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
from the man of genius; and the Reformation&mdash;type of
the holy cause of human progress&mdash;have advanced
without the lamentable compromise of principle it
suffered when its leaders sent one of the very foremost
men of his age to the stake.</p>

<p>In presence of the individual he had come to look
on as his personal enemy as well as the enemy of God,
Calvin appears to have forgotten all his earlier aspirations
after toleration. He was not now thinking of
himself as editor of ‘Seneca on Clemency,’ when to the
text of his author enjoining self-control or moderation
of mind&mdash;<i>animi temperantia</i>&mdash;having the power to take
vengeance, he adds: ‘It belongs to the nature of the
merciful man that he not only uses opportunities of
vengeance with moderation, but does not avail himself
of even the most tempting occasions to take revenge;’<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a>&mdash;a
noble sentence, but written in days long past, when
he saw persecution for conscience sake inaugurated by
Francis I. Neither had he himself as author of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
earlier editions of the ‘Institutions’ in his mind, where
he is as emphatic in denouncing the ‘Right of the Sword’
in dealing with heresy as he was now, having become
the spiritual dictator of Geneva, ready to call it at all
times into requisition. Calvin’s natural temperament,
in fact, disposed him to severity in furtherance of
his purposes and his will. We have seen him in his
letter to Farel of February 1546, threatening Servetus
with death, did opportunity serve; and writing to a
French lady&mdash;Madame de Cany&mdash;about or a little before
the time that now engages us, in referring to some one
who had behaved ungratefully both to his correspondent
and himself, he says: ‘I assure you, madam, that
had he not taken himself off so speedily, I should have
held it my duty, in so far as it lay with me, to have had
him burned alive.’<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></p>

<p>But everything seemed to conspire against Servetus
at the moment of his reaching Geneva; for almost
immediately after his arrival there, and whilst his
presence was still unknown to Calvin, the Reformer
received a letter from a correspondent, Paul Gaddi of
Cremona by name, that must have greatly strengthened
his fears of Servetus’s objectionable influence in the
world, and, on theological grounds, confirmed him in
his purpose of pushing matters to extremities and
silencing the dangerous heretic for ever, did he but find
the opportunity. Gaddi, as it seems, had lately reached
Z&uuml;rich from the north of Italy. At Ferrara, he informs
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
his correspondent that he had had many long
and interesting conversations with the Duchess, who
showed the very best and most friendly dispositions
towards the Reformed Faith. But she was sorely in
want of a competent person, ‘a faithful Minister of the
word of God,’ as a guide against those by whom she
was surrounded. Gaddi, therefore, at the desire of the
Duchess requests Calvin to send her some one who
would give her true instruction, and free her from the
teaching ‘of the miserable Monk she has at her elbow,
who seeks not after what Christ requires, but after the
things that be profitable to himself.’</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘Much have I seen in these [northern] Italian cities,’ continues
Gaddi, ‘and many have I met with who profess Christ;
but few and far between are those who faithfully serve the
Lord. Various, truly, are the heresies that there abound,
so that the land is, in truth, a very Babylon. This, you may
be sure, I have not beheld without extreme distress of mind
and tearful eyes; but the heresy that flourishes the most of
all, is the doctrine of the proud and Satanic Servetus, insomuch
that many of the faithful entreat you to come forward,
and controvert his writings; a task to which they think you
are the more bound to apply yourself, as he boasts that no
one has yet dared to write against him. I, too, if my entreaty
may be of any avail, beseech you to undertake the business.
I know the influence your writings have with all in Italy, who
fear God. If you deigned to take pen in hand against George
[he had published a tract against predestination], who was
every way unworthy of your notice, for he was plunged in the
deepest ignorance, how much rather ought you to come forward
against this diabolical spirit, who is looked on by so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
many as having the highest authority in matters of doctrine.
And truly his teaching, though it be of the most impious and
pestilent kind, is calculated to impose on those whose eyes
serve them not to see far before them. Wherefore, I entreat
you yet again, to undertake the task I propose. Postpone, I
pray you, for a few days your other studies; betake you to
this most necessary work, and be the hammer that shall smite
the enemy.</p>

<h2 id="BOOK_II_CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="center">SERVETUS IS ARRAIGNED ON THE CAPITAL CHARGE
BY CALVIN.</p>

<p>In ordering the summary arrest of Servetus at the
instance of Calvin, as we have seen, the Syndic only
conformed with usage. But by the law of Geneva
grounds for an arrest on a criminal charge must be delivered
to an officer styled <i>Le Lieutenant Criminel</i>,
or the Lieutenant of Criminal Process&mdash;a personage
evidently holding a responsible position in the city&mdash;within
twenty-four hours thereafter, failing which the
party attached was set at liberty. To prepare the
articles of impeachment required, Calvin must have
spent the greater part of the night, turning over the
leaves of the ‘Christianismi Restitutio,’ for the matter
of his charges. These bear very obvious marks of the
haste in which they were put together, several of them
being repetitions of others that had gone before, and
scarcely anything like order being observed in the
arrangement of the particulars adduced. Within the
legal time, however, the prosecutor was ready with his
articles, no fewer than thirty-eight in number, upon
which, as a preliminary to further proceedings, it was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
the duty of the ‘<i>Lieutenant Criminel</i>’ to interrogate the
prisoner, and from his replies to determine whether or
not there were grounds to found what we should call
a True Bill against him.</p>

<p>Nor was this all. Criminal charges must be made
at the instance of some one who should avow himself
aggrieved, and not only bind himself over to prosecute
the suit he sought to institute to a conclusion, but be
content to go to prison with the party he accused, and,
in conformity with the requirements of the Lex Talionis,
or law of retaliation, engage, in case his charges were
not made good, to undergo the penalty that would befall
the incriminated party if they were substantiated.</p>

<p>It would of course have been not only inconvenient,
but unbecoming for Calvin, the real prosecutor in the
case, to go into durance vile, his presence in the outer
world being so much required. He had therefore to
procure a substitute; and we might have expected to
find William Trie again brought forward, and made to
figure in setting on foot the trial for life or death at
Geneva, as he had already lent himself to figure in
that of Vienne. But Trie was not produced; it was a
certain Nicolas de la Fontaine, a French refugee in the
service of Calvin, in what capacity report speaks
variously, some designating him cook, whilst others, to
enhance his dignity, call him the Reformer’s Secretary.
Calvin himself speaks of him familiarly as <i>Nicolaus meus</i>,
my man Nicolas. That Fontaine was really the Reformer’s
cook seems now to have been satisfactorily
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
ascertained; but he may have been a man of parts
and education for all that; refugees for conscience
sake could not always choose their calling in their new
abodes.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a></p>

<p>On the morning of August 14th, accordingly, Nicolas
de la Fontaine presented himself before the <i>Lieutenant
Criminel</i>, Tissot, and the prisoner having been produced,
De la Fontaine declared himself formally the
Prosecutor of Michael Servetus of Villanova on certain
criminal charges, demanding at the same time that the
prisoner should, under penalties, be required to answer
truthfully to each of the articles now to be alleged
against him.</p>

<p>These articles, thirty-eight in number, are taken
exclusively from Servetus’s work entitled ‘Christianismi
Restitutio,’ which is assumed as having been published
and found detrimental to the public peace (although it
had as yet been seen by no one in Geneva but Calvin
himself), not any of them from the earlier work entitled
‘De Trinitatis Erroribus,’ the printing of which and its
presumed influence in troubling the Churches of
Germany, infecting the world with heresy and causing
many to lose their souls, being nevertheless, as we see,
the first item in the list of its author’s delinquencies.
Calvin must have seen the propriety of producing the
treatise on Trinitarian Error, published two and twenty
years ago; but he had not a copy himself, neither could
he hear of one either in Geneva or Lausanne; for he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
had written to his friend Viret for aid in the matter.
But Viret could not help him&mdash;he had no copy himself;
his friend Sonnerius, however, he thinks, has one;
‘were he at home he would not assuredly refuse us the
use of it.’ Obtaining it on Sonnerius’s return, he will
send it with the least possible delay to Geneva.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></p>

<p>The articles of impeachment, classified and summarised,
with the answers of Servetus, are as follows:</p>

<p>I. and II. That about twenty-four years ago he
began to trouble the Churches of Germany with his
errors and heresies, and published an execrably heretical
book by which he infected many, and for which
he had been condemned and forced to fly the country
that he might escape punishment.</p>

<p>To this Servetus replies: That he is not conscious
of having troubled any of the Churches of Germany;
and though he owns that he had published a little
book at Hagenau, he is not aware that he had infected
anyone, and certainly was never either tried or condemned
for anything he had done in Germany, neither
had he been forced to fly from that country to
escape punishment.</p>

<p>III. and IV. Item: That he has not ceased since
then from spreading abroad his poison, in annotations
to the Bible and to the Geography of Ptolemy, and
more recently in a second book, clandestinely printed,
containing an infinity of blasphemies, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Replies: That it is true he wrote notes to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
Bible and to Ptolemy; but thinks he said nothing in
them that is not good; and in the book lately printed,
he does not believe that he blasphemes; but if it be
shown him that he says anything amiss he is ready to
amend it.</p>

<p>V. Item: That having been imprisoned at Vienne,
when he saw that the authorities there would not accept
of his retractations, he had found means to escape
from prison.</p>

<p>Replies: That he was indeed prisoner at Vienne,
having been denounced to the authorities there by
Monsieur Calvin and Guillaume Trie, and had made
his escape from prison, because the Priests would have
burned him alive had he stayed; the prison, however,
having been so kept that it seemed as though the
authorities meant him to save himself.</p>

<p>VI., VII., VIII. Item: That he had written, published,
and said that to believe there were three distinct
persons: Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, in the single
essence of God was to forge or feign so many phantoms;
to have a God parted into three, like the three-headed
Cerberus of the heathen poets; all this being
said in the face of such doctors of the Church as
Ambrose, Augustin, Chrysostom, Athanasius, and the
rest, as well as of many holy men of the present day&mdash;Melanchthon
among the number, whom he had called
a Belial and Satan.</p>

<p>Replies: That in the book he wrote on the Trinity,
he had followed the teaching of the Doctors who lived
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
immediately after Christ and the Apostles; that he
believes in a Trinity&mdash;Father, Son, and Holy Ghost&mdash;but
owns that he does not attach the same meaning to
the word <i>person</i> as do modern writers; and though he
admits that he spoke of Melanchthon in the terms
stated, it was not in any printed book or in public,
but in a private letter; whilst Melanchthon, on his
part, and in a printed book, had used language of the
same kind towards him.</p>

<p>IX. to XX. and XXVI. The whole of these articles,
with wearisome prolixity and iteration, refer to the
transcendental theological dogmas that touch on the
way and manner in which Christ is to be regarded as
the Son of God; the relationship in which He stands
to the ‘Word’ of the Gospel according to John, and how
the Word was made Flesh; in what respect Christ is
God, and in what respect he is Man, and how, as the
Son of God, he could have died like a man. To these
recondite propositions Servetus replies in a way that
has a sufficient look of orthodoxy, and was evidently
intended by him so to appear. He avows his belief
in the items generally on which he is challenged with
unbelief; and it may be that he could do so with a
clear conscience, he putting his own interpretation on
the language he used. Christ he acknowledged as the
Son of God, but this was because of his having been
begotten in some mysterious way by the Deity in the
womb of the Virgin Mary, He not having existed
actually but only potentially in the mind of God before
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
the epoch of his incarnation. Christ, however, he
says, was <i>prefigured</i> by the angels who make their appearance
from time to time in the Hebrew Scriptures.
When <i>persons</i> are spoken of, further, they are to be
thought of as <i>images</i>, <i>formalities</i>, not real entities or
individuals; so that the three persons he acknowledges
in the Godhead are but so many <i>dispensations</i>, <i>modes</i>,
or <i>manifestations</i> which the Invisible God makes of
himself in creation.</p>

<p>XXIV., XXV. and XXXV. These articles bear
upon Servetus’s conceptions of the Deity, in whose
Oneness of Being he declares that he yet acknowledges
not merely three <i>hypostases</i>, as generally said, but a
hundred thousand <i>dispositions</i> or <i>dispensations</i>, so that
God is part of ourselves, we part of His Spirit; the
<i>ideas</i> or <i>patterns</i> of all creatures and of all things having
been eternally present in the Divine Mind, though
they only acquired form and substance in Creation.</p>

<p>XXVII. and XXIX. Item: That he had said
that the soul of man was mortal; that there was nothing
immortal in fact, but an elementary breath, the
soul having become mortal after Adam’s transgression.</p>

<p>He replies by denying the allegations, and declares
that he never thought the soul of man to be mortal;
all he has said in his writings in connection with the
subject of immortality being to the effect that the soul
was clothed in corruptible elements which perished, not
that the soul itself was mortal or died in its essence.</p>

<p>XXX., XXXI., and XXXIII. Item: That he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
had spoken of Infant Baptism as a diabolical invention,
competent to destroy the whole of Christianity.</p>

<p>He admits that he has said so, and is still of this
opinion; believing as he does that none should be baptized
until they had attained to years of discretion.
But he adds, that if it be shown him he is mistaken in
this, he is ready to submit to correction.</p>

<p>XXXVII. Item: That in his printed book he
has made use of scurrilous and blasphemous terms of
reproach in speaking of M. Calvin and the Doctrines
of the Church of Geneva.</p>

<p>Replies: That he himself had had abusive language
applied to him by Calvin in public; Calvin
having said that he, Servetus, was intoxicated with
his opinions; a reproach which had led him to reply in
similar terms to his opponent, and to show at the same
time from his writings that he was mistaken in many
things.</p>

<p>XXXVIII. Item: That knowing his last book
would not be suffered, even among the Papists, he
had concealed his views from Geroult, the superintendent
of the office where it was printed.</p>

<p>Replies: That he corrected the press at Vienne,
but did not conceal his views from Geroult, who knew
well enough what his opinions were.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>August 15.</i> The information taken by the Lieutenant
in conformity with the course of procedure
required having been communicated to the Syndics
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
and Council now constituted Judges in a criminal case,
and, the Court of Judicature solemnly inaugurated, the
prosecutor and prisoner were produced; when Nicolas
de la Fontaine made a formal demand that Michael
Servetus of Villanova, whom he charged with heresy,
should be put upon his trial. He presented an address
or petition, at the same time, in which the heads of the
charges he proposed to prove against the prisoner
were briefly enumerated, namely, the grave scandals
and troubles he had caused among Christians for
twenty-four years or thereabout; the heresies and
blasphemies he had spoken and written against God
with which he had infected the world; the wicked
calumnies and defamations he had published against
the true servants of God, more especially against
Monsieur Calvin, whose honour as his Pastor, he&mdash;the
prosecutor&mdash;felt bound to uphold if he himself would
be accounted a Christian, and also because of the discredit
that would attach to the Church of Geneva, did
the prisoner go at large, condemning, as he does, and
in an especial manner, the doctrine that is there
preached. ‘In as much, therefore,’ continues Calvin
through the mouth of Fontaine, ‘as the prisoner on his
examination yesterday replied in nowise satisfactorily
and simply by yea or nay to the questions put to him,
as you must have perceived, the greater number of his
answers being mere frivolous songs, may it please your
Lordships to compel him to answer formally, without
divergence or circumlocution, to each of the articles
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
proposed; to the end that he be not suffered to go on
mocking God and your Excellencies, and that the proponent
be not frustrated in his rights.</p>

<p>‘Now the proponent having <i>prima facie</i> made good
his allegations and satisfied you that the prisoner has
been guilty of writing heresy and dogmatising in the
manner alleged, he begs you humbly to recognise the
prisoner Michael Servetus as a criminal deserving of
prosecution by your attorney-general; and that he, the
proponent, be now declared free of all charge, damage,
and interest in the business. Not that he shuns or
declines to follow up a cause of the kind, which every
child of God ought indeed to pursue to the death, but
in compliance with the usages of your city, and because
it is not for him to undertake duties that belong to
another.’</p>

<p>Having taken this petition into consideration, and
determined that there was <i>prima facie</i> evidence of
criminality on the part of the prisoner, the Council
proceeded in the afternoon of the same day to the old
Episcopal Palace, now turned into the Court in which
criminal causes were tried, and commenced proceedings
according to the forms in such cases used and
provided.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span></p>

<h2 id="BOOK_II_CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="center">THE TRIAL IN ITS FIRST PHASE.</p>

<p>Formally installed in the Court of Criminal Judicature,
Nicolas de la Fontaine and Michael Servetus were
ordered to be brought before them by the Judges; and
the prosecutor declaring that he persisted in his allegations,
and the prisoner being put on his oath to speak
the truth under penalties to the extent of 60 sols, the
Trial commenced.</p>

<p>To the question as to his name and condition, the
prisoner replied that his name was Michael Serveto, of
Villanova, in the kingdom of Aragon, in Spain, and
that by profession he was a physician. The articles
of impeachment already produced were then restated
seriatim, and to each he was required to answer categorically.
This he did, and generally in the terms
he had used in his preliminary examination, but accusing
Calvin, and Calvin alone, more imperatively
than before, of having provoked his arrest and prosecution
at Vienne, adding that had Calvin had his
way, he&mdash;the prisoner&mdash;would assuredly have been
burned alive. To all that had reference to the Doctrine
of the Trinity, the Nature of Christ, the relations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
between God and created things, he spoke as he had
already done. He again and pointedly denied that he
had ever said the soul was mortal; but admitted having
written that he thinks man commits no mortal sin before
the age of twenty years, adding that ‘under the Law
God had so ordered it.’ The Baptism of Infants he
acknowledged to be in his eyes a diabolical invention,
and calculated to corrupt the whole of Christianity;
declaring however, as formerly, that if it were shown he
erred in this opinion he was ready to retract and amend.</p>

<p>As to the alleged attacks on the Church of Geneva
through the person of Calvin, he answered as before,
and now added that all he had written against Calvin
was with no view or desire to calumniate or injure him,
but only to show him his errors; and he now offers in
open congregation to make good his words by a variety
of reasons, and the authority of the Scriptures.</p>

<p>This was to throw down the gauntlet to Calvin and
offer him battle on ground he could not decline, since
he too acknowledged no authority but holy writ, and we
need not doubt of his readiness to take up the pledge:
there was nothing indeed, as he declared, for he was
present in Court watching the proceedings, that he
desired more than to show himself in such a cause
before all the world.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> The Court may be excused for
having imagined that in agreeing to such a wordy duel
between Calvin and Servetus they would be letting the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
question slip out of their proper hands; or, as M.
Albert Rilliet<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> suggests, the friends whom Servetus
had among its members, measuring the mental
calibre of the two men, may have feared to see him
they favoured worsted by his redoubtable opponent,
whose dialectical skill and theological lore were so
well known to all. Deciding against the proposal of
the prisoner, therefore, the tribunal determined that the
trial should proceed in the usual way.</p>

<p>So far as they had gone we can readily conceive
that the answers of Servetus must have seemed little
satisfactory to the Court. On even a large proportion
of the allegations made, they may have felt their incompetency
to form an opinion; but upon a few they
believed themselves fully able to come to a conclusion.
What he had said on Infant Baptism in particular was
greatly calculated to prejudice him in the minds of his
Judges; the doctrine he held being one among the
dangerous moral, social, and political principles of the
Anabaptists, though the whole of these were emphatically
disavowed and condemned by Servetus, who
really appears to have had nothing in common with the
dreaded sect but the opinion that Baptism should not
be performed until years of discretion were attained,
and that the rite should be solemnised by immersion or
affusion, not by merely sprinkling the face with water.</p>

<p>The decision of the Court at the end of the day’s
proceedings was to the effect that, as the answers of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
prisoner Michael Servetus implied criminality, the trial
should go on; but that the prosecutor, Nicolas de la
Fontaine, whilst bound over to continue the suit, might
be released on the production of sufficient bail; and
this being immediately forthcoming in the person of
Monsieur Antoine Calvin, brother of the Reformer,
Calvin’s substitute and <i>Chef de Cuisine</i> was discharged
from custody, whilst Servetus was remanded to gaol.
Thus formally constituted prisoner on a criminal
charge, Servetus now delivered to the gaoler all the
money and valuables he possessed, the coin amounting
to ninety-seven gold crowns, the valuables being a
gold chain of the value of twenty crowns, and as many
as seven gold rings set with a table diamond, a ruby
and other stones of price.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>August 16, the Court, constituted as usual, was observed
to be less numerously attended than on the day
before, but with two important additions: Philibert Berthelier
among the Councillors, by right, and Germain
Colladon, introduced as Counsel for De la Fontaine.
Between these two men, says M. Rilliet, more perhaps
than between any other notable members of the Republic
of Geneva, the contrast was striking and complete.
They might even severally have been assumed
as representatives of the parties which divided the
state and contended for mastery. Berthelier was the
acknowledged head of the patriotic party, mostly native
Genevese, the Libertines as they were called, from their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
zealous defence of the immunities and privileges of the
citizens against the old tyranny of the Roman Catholic
Bishops and the recently introduced consistorial rules
and regulations of the Reformer. As son of one of
the martyrs to the public liberties of Geneva, and
possessed of wealth and influence, Berthelier had long
been opposed to the authority of Calvin; his patriotism
and his self-respect revolting against the domineering
character of the man and the stringency of his religious
and sumptuary regulations, so that the struggle in
which he and Colladon now engaged, with the unhappy
Servetus as their subject of contention, was but an
interlude in the strife that had been carried on between
Berthelier and Calvin for years.</p>

<p>In Calvin’s arrest and prosecution of Servetus there
can be no question that Berthelier, making light of
the theological grounds on which the Spaniard was
arraigned, and trusting to the strength of his party in
the Council, believed he saw a means and opportunity
of worsting his old irreconcilable enemy. He thought
little, and it may be perhaps felt somewhat indifferent
as to the fate that would befal the individual whose
cause he espoused, did he fail in the purpose he proposed
to himself. Hate of Calvin blinded him to more
remote contingencies.</p>

<p>Colladon, engaged of course by Calvin on behalf of
Nicolas de la Fontaine and the prosecution, was a man
of a totally different stamp from Berthelier. A refugee
from France, his native country, for conscience sake,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
and seeking in Geneva freedom to enjoy his religious
convictions; austere in disposition, rigid in morals and
punctilious in outward observance, he had been forced
to fly from his home in consequence of zeal too openly
expressed for the cause of the Reformation. Safe in
Geneva, he gave himself heart and soul to Calvin, and
was found by him among the most useful of his auxiliaries
in formulating his discipline and enforcing its observance,
Colladon’s familiarity with business and his
legal knowledge qualifying him in every way for the
part he was ambitious to play. The party of which he
was a distinguished member were now in the minority,
but did not so remain for long. Within two years of
the time that engages us, they had gained the ascendency,
and were not slow to avenge themselves on the
legitimate sons of Geneva by forcing them in numbers
into banishment, and filling their places by naturalising
the French and Italian refugees, who continued pouring
into Geneva in crowds, to escape the persecution that
then raged in their native countries.</p>

<p>The fiery dispute in which Berthelier and Colladon
engaged at this day’s sitting, seems to have concerned
Calvin much more than Servetus, its ostensible subject:
the French <i>Reformer</i> of Christianity far more than its
would-be Spanish <i>Restorer</i>, was the true object of the
attack and defence. The debate in the old episcopal
palace, in a word, was between the representatives of
the two factions that contended for supremacy in
Geneva.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span></p>

<p>We have unfortunately no complete account of
what transpired on this the first encounter between Berthelier
and Colladon. The Records of the Criminal
Court are significantly silent on the subject; but that
it was violent there can be no question, so violent
that the morning sitting had to be suspended before
the usual hour of rising. Yet are we at no loss to
divine the ground on which the presumed altercation
arose, when we note the point where the blank in the
proceedings occurs, coming as it does in immediate
connection with the articles having reference to the
subject of the Trinity. Servetus, in the course of the
interrogatory to which he was subjected, having replied
equivocally or unsatisfactorily as to the sense in which
the word person is to be understood in speaking of the
Trinitarian Mystery, Colladon must have contended
that he could show by various passages of the printed
book before the Court, that the prisoner now spoke
otherwise of the Trinity than he really believed, and
proceeded to handle him somewhat sharply, in the way
Counsel learned in the Law are still wont to treat those
they have under cross-examination; somewhat unfairly,
too, as Berthelier may have thought, so that he interposed,
and must even have said something not only in
defence of the prisoner, but of the opinions incriminated.
And here it was, and in consequence of the warmth of
the debate, that the proceedings had to be suspended.</p>

<p>Before breaking up, a number of books, which had
been produced by the Counsel for the prosecution in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
support of his case, were directed to be left with the
clerk of the Court; and each party in the suit, having
noted its case, was ordered to be in readiness to go on
at the next sitting. The books in question were the
works of Melanchthon and the letters of Œcolampadius,
the Geography of Ptolemy, and the Bible of Pagnini;
the two last of which the prisoner owned to having
edited and annotated. The most important of all,
however, was the ‘Christianismi Restitutio,’ upon the
interpretation of some of the passages of which, in
contrast with the present replies of the prisoner, arose
the altercation that led to the momentary suspension of
the proceedings.</p>

<p>From the Registers of the Grand Council we learn
that on the morrow of the stormy session of the sixteenth,
Calvin presented himself before the Council and
demanded an audience. He had learned, he said, that
Philibert Berthelier had meddled in the suit against
Michael Servetus, and even spoken in defence of some
of the incriminated passages of the prisoner’s book&mdash;a
mortal offence in Calvin’s eyes, and an indication, not to
be mistaken, of hostility to himself as virtual pursuer of
the obnoxious heretic. The time had come, in fact, when,
throwing aside disguise, Calvin must come from behind
Nicolas de la Fontaine, avow himself the prosecutor,
and nip in the bud, if he could, the new growth of rebellion
against his rule for which Servetus, he saw, was
now to be made the pretext.</p>

<p>In the interference of Berthelier, which we see
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
must have given such umbrage to Calvin, we have the
first open indication by the Libertine party of their
sympathy with the prisoner; sympathy, real or pretended,
that may be said to have sealed the fate of the
unhappy Servetus; for the issue, though continuing to
be debated on the ground of speculative theology, on
which so many questions might be raised and doubts
entertained, was henceforth to a certain extent transferred
to the domain of politics, on which there was
the one practical issue involved, as to who or which
party that divided the state of Geneva should have the
upper hand.</p>

<p>It may be fairly presumed that Calvin, with the
great advantage he had in natural talent and acquirements,
had no difficulty in satisfying the majority of the
Judges of the culpability of Servetus on theological
grounds; his opinions differed too obviously from all
they had ever been led to believe concerning the
Trinity and Infant Baptism, especially, to leave them
in any doubt as to this. Servetus differed, in fact, on
every point brought forward, from the doctrine familiar
to the mind of Geneva&mdash;enough of itself to lay him
under suspicion; and, accepting Calvin’s interpretation
of the incriminated passages of his book, which his
Judges must have felt bound in some sort to do, they
could have had nothing for it, had the prosecution now
insisted on having made out their case, but to proceed to
judgment, and pronounce the prisoner guilty. But this
was not done; the Judges appear not only to have felt
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
no kind of hostility towards the solitary stranger in the
singular and painful position in which he stood, but
even to have been moved to something like compassion
in his behalf.</p>

<p>After the suspension of the early sitting of the
16th in consequence of the stormy scene between
Berthelier and Colladon, and a pause to permit
the minds of all to regain a state of calm befitting
the circumstances, proceedings of an informal kind
only were taken later in the day. These are interesting,
nevertheless, because of the recommendation of the
Judges to Calvin in sequence to his avowal of himself as
virtual prosecutor, to use every fair endeavour to bring
the prisoner to what were thought to be better views,
as well as to furnish the Court with further and more
satisfactory evidence of his heretical guiltiness. To this
end Calvin was requested by the Court to visit the
prisoner, ‘the better to show him his errors&mdash;<i>affin que
myeux luy puyssent estre remonstr&eacute;es ses erreurs</i>: to
assist him, <i>&agrave; assister luy</i>, and to do what he could with
him in respect of the interrogatories put to him, <i>et qu’il
vouldra avec luy aux interrogatoires</i>. This surely is
both interesting and important. The Court would
have spared the man, and given him an opportunity of
coming to an understanding with the prosecutor on the
difficult matters in debate between them. We shall
accordingly find by-and-by that Calvin, accompanied by
a number of ministers, in compliance with the benevolent
intentions of the Court, paid Servetus a visit in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
prison; but with results that might have been foreseen&mdash;not
only not advantageous to him, but damaging in
the highest degree to his interests.</p>

<p>On the resumption of proceedings next day, August
17, Calvin took his seat on the Bench, and under
him, in the area, were seen a number of ministers, his
colleagues, specially introduced, as said, to show the
prisoner his errors, but all, like their leader, we fear,
rather bent on convicting the dangerous heretic than
hopeful of convincing and winning over the mistaken
theologian.</p>

<p>Colladon, as counsel for the prosecution, now went
on with his interrogatories as at the last meeting; and
various particulars which had hitherto remained in
the shade were brought prominently forward. Among
others it was positively averred that the prisoner had
been tried and condemned in Germany, a point only
hinted at before; and passages from private letters by
Melanchthon and Œcolampadius were quoted in support
of the allegation. In these the severest censure
is certainly passed on the views of the prisoner; but,
as he observed, the adverse opinions of the Reformers
referred to by no means implied that he had ever
been the subject of any judicial trial or condemnation
in Germany; a remark for which Colladon had no
better rejoinder than to say that had he and his printer
been apprehended and tried, they would undoubtedly
have been condemned.</p>

<p>Questioned as to who was the printer of his book
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
on ‘Trinitarian Error,’ he said it was Joannes Secerius
of Hagenau. On this, Colladon went on to say that
the book was full of heretical poison, and that it was impossible
it should not have infected many persons. But
there was no evidence adduced to show that it had; and
it is not unimportant to observe that Colladon’s statements
here are based on a document which is not
before the Court, a copy of the book on ‘Trinitarian
Error,’ though eagerly sought after, as we have seen,
not being anywhere to be found.</p>

<p>On the note or scholium in the Ptolemy, calling in
question the truth of the Bible account of Jud&aelig;a as a
land flowing with milk and honey, on which he was
challenged, Servetus declared that it was not by him,
but quoted from another writer, adding incautiously,
from himself, however, that the note contained nothing
reprehensible or that was not true. This aroused the
ire of Calvin, who now interposed, not certainly in
agreement with the recommendation of the Court to
show the prisoner that he had been led into error
through false information, as he might have done, but
to declare that he who approved the words of another
characterising Jud&aelig;a as no land flowing with milk and
honey, but as meagre, barren, and inhospitable, necessarily
inculpated Moses; and that to use such language
was egregiously to outrage the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>Servetus, however, would not agree to this, coolly
denying any such conclusion; insomuch so, as Calvin
himself tells us, in no very choice terms, that ‘the villainous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
cur&mdash;<i>ce vilain chien</i>&mdash;though put to shame by
the obvious reasons adduced, did but wipe his muzzle,
<i>ne fit que torcher son museau</i>, and say: Let us go on,
there is no harm here&mdash;<i>passons oultre, il n’y a poynt l&agrave;
de mal</i>’.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></p>

<p>Another important article of the impeachment
brought into prominence in this day’s proceedings was
from among the prisoner’s annotations to the reprint
of Santes Pagnini’s Bible, which he supervised, as we
know, for Hugo de la Porte, the publisher of Lyons.
This Bible was said by the prosecution to be encumbered
with many glosses or comments totally opposed
to the Faith; the one most notably so of all perhaps
being appended to the thirty-third chapter of Isaiah,
where the servant of God who took on himself the
sins of the people is spoken of by the Prophet. ‘This
passage,’ said Calvin, ‘is referred by the prisoner to
Cyrus, whilst every Christian Church refers it to Jesus
Christ.’ But Servetus was again bold enough to maintain
his position in so far as to say that the interpretation
he had given of the passage was borne out in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
some sort by the opinions of the old Doctors of the
Church, who acknowledged, as he said, a twofold sense
in the Scriptures&mdash;one, literal and historical, applying
to contemporaneous personages and events; another,
mystical and prophetic, bearing on Christ and the
future. ‘In speaking of the individual referred to, as he
had done, and calling him Cyrus, he said that he nevertheless
held the prophetical and most important bearing
of the text to be on Christ.’ But this did not
satisfy Calvin. He would by no means accept such an
explanation, and far from attempting by reason and
kindness to win the prisoner to views which he himself
believed to be more in conformity with the truth, he
launched out in passion, and declared that ‘the prisoner
would never have had the hardihood thus villainously
to corrupt so grand a passage had he not, abandoning
all shame, taken he knew not what diabolical pleasure in
getting rid of the whole Christian faith.’ The cool way
in which Servetus stood this outburst appears to have
irritated the Reformer extremely. Servetus was in
truth far in advance of Calvin and his age in his
exegesis. He was not blind, like all about him, to the
true import of the Hebrew writings styled prophetical,
but divined their only possible bearing upon events
and individuals contemporaneous with their writers&mdash;in
some cases even past and gone. It was to escape
doing violence to the idea of the inspiration under
which Servetus credited these ancient writings to have
been composed, that he acknowledged a prospective
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
reference to incidents still in the womb of far distant
time.</p>

<p>The printing of the ‘Christianismi Restitutio’ was
next adduced and made a principal topic of accusation
against the prisoner. To the question what object he
had proposed to himself in having the book printed,
he replied that his main purpose was to ventilate his
opinions and have them controverted in case they
were seen to be erroneous. But Calvin rejoined that
it was by no means necessary to print in order to obtain
correction of erroneous opinions, and this more
especially in a case such as his, where, as writer, he had
already been admonished of his errors.</p>

<p>The delicate, difficult, and most essential element in
the impeachment, that, namely, having reference to the
Doctrine of the Trinity, was now and again brought
into the foreground. Particularly questioned on this
subject, Servetus maintained, that previous to the
Council of Nic&aelig;a no Doctor of the Church had used
the word <i>Trinity</i>; and that if the Fathers did acknowledge
a distinction in the Divine Essence, it was not
<i>real</i> but <i>formal</i>; that the <i>persons</i> were nothing more
in truth than <i>dispensations</i> or modes, not distinct entities
or <i>persons</i> in the usual acceptation of that word.
If he had called the Doctrine of the Trinity, as commonly
understood, a dream of St. Augustine and an
invention of the Devil, which he did not deny; if he
had further characterised the Trinity of modern theologians
as a three-headed monster, like the Cerberus
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
of the poets, and styled those who overlooked the true
Trinity, which he himself recognised, as Tritheists, it
was solely because he believed the unity of God to be
denied or annulled by such a procedure. Colladon on
this&mdash;and prompted we may presume by Calvin&mdash;maintained
that the views imputed to the Fathers of
the Church by the prisoner were false as well as mischievous,
and that he could adduce none but apocryphal
writings full of absurdities in support of what he
said.</p>

<p>Most of the other views and opinions of the prisoner
which were quoted as heretical in the act of impeachment
were either owned to by him, interpreted
in the way he understood them, or were taken as
proven by the Court; passages in support of this conclusion
having been referred to not only in the printed
copy of the ‘Restoration of Christianity,’ but in the
manuscript sent privately six years before to Calvin
for his strictures. There is one particular, however,
not mentioned in the record of proceedings, but given
by Calvin,<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> that is not uninteresting, as showing the
extreme pantheistic views to which Servetus had attained,
and may have prejudiced him not a little in the
eyes of his Judges, the air of offensive absurdity which
the pantheistic doctrine&mdash;adversely understood&mdash;assumes
when pushed to extremes, being made so prominently
to appear. The question had turned on the
relations between the Divine substance and the substance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
of creatures and things. ‘All things, all creatures,’
said Servetus, ‘are portions of the substance of
God.’ Speaking in his own person, and interposing at
this point, Calvin says: ‘Annoyed as I was by so
palpable an absurdity, I answered: What, poor man,
did one stamp on this floor with his foot and say he
trod on God, would not you be horrified in having
subjected the Majesty of God to such unworthy usage?’
He, on this, replied: ‘I have not a doubt but that this
bench, this table, and all you can point to around us, is
of the substance of God.’ When it was then objected
to him that on such showing the Devil must be of God
substantially; he, smiling impudently, said: ‘Do you
doubt it? For my part,’ continued he, ‘I hold it as a
general proposition that all things whatsoever are part
and parcel of God, and that nature at large is His substantial
manifestation.’ Calvin, we imagine, might have
spared Servetus on this head when we call to mind
how he commits himself to pantheistic views in that
passage of his ‘Institutions’ we have already referred to,
where he says he only objects to call Nature God because
of the harshness and impropriety of the expression.
He might further, with reference to the Devil,
have bethought him of the verse of Isaiah xlv. 7,
where these words occur as coming from Jehovah
himself: ‘I form the Light and create Darkness; I
make peace and create evil.’ Or of this from Amos
iii. 6: ‘Shall there be evil in a city and the Lord
hath not done it?’ Or yet this of Ezekiel xx. 25:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
‘I gave them statutes that were not good,’ &amp;c. The
Jews, through by far the greater part of their history, as
a people acknowledged no Dualism in their Deity, as,
indeed, they only looked on their God Jahveh as the
greatest among the Gods. He was the good and
the evil principle in one. But it is easy to imagine
the damaging impression which Servetus’s logical but
terribly unorthodox statement must have made on the
minds of his Judges, ill-informed presumably as they
were on such questions. Had Calvin been minded to
help instead of determined to crush Servetus, he might
even have quoted Luther, who speaks in this wise in
his Table Talk: ‘God is present in all created things,
and so in the smallest leaflet and tiniest poppy-seed&mdash;Gott
also gegenw&auml;rtig ist in allen Creaturen; auch im
geringsten Bl&auml;ttlein und Mohnk&ouml;rnlein.’</p>

<p>Nor were the personal griefs of Calvin overlooked in
the inculpation of the prisoner. Beside the thirty letters
printed in the ‘Christianismi Restitutio,’ addressed
to the Reformer, a copy of his ‘Institutions’ was now
laid before the Court. This, like the MS. of the
‘Restitutio,’ sent privately and confidentially to Calvin,
was covered on the margins with numerous annotations,
little in conformity, as may be supposed, with
the accepted tenets of the Church of Geneva, and more
rarely still complimentary to the author. At such insolent
procedure we know that Calvin was greatly
offended, as appears by the language he thought fit to
use when writing to Viret and incidentally noticing the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
liberties that had been taken with him by the annotator:
‘There is not a page of the book,’ he says, ‘that
is not befouled with his vomit.’</p>

<p>Neither was the tergiversation of the prisoner in
what he had said about Geroult’s part in the printing
of the ‘Restitutio’ unnoticed. He is now reproached
with the variations in his replies on the subject to
the Lieutenant on the 14th, and to the Court on the
15th. His first answer we believe was truthful&mdash;Geroult
knew all about the book, as we shall find from
a letter of Arnoullet to his friend Bertet; his second was
untruthful, but uttered to shield the man who had aided
him in his enterprise, compromised, as he had come to
see, by what he had said before.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span></p>

<h2 id="BOOK_II_CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="center">THE TRIAL IN ITS SECOND PHASE, WITH THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL
OF GENEVA AS PROSECUTOR.</p>

<p>Arrived at this stage, all the documents on which it
was proposed to proceed being before the Court, and
something more than a presumption of the prisoner’s
heretical opinions having already been made to appear,
Nicolas de la Fontaine, on his petition to that effect,
and his bail, Anthony Calvin, were formally discharged
as parties to the suit, its further prosecution being
handed over to Claude Rigot, the Attorney-General of
the city of Geneva.</p>

<p>Before breaking up, however, and as if to occupy
the time until the usual hour of rising, a number of
questions irrelevant to the main plea, but tending to
gratify the curiosity of the Court, were put to the
prisoner. Among the number of these he was asked
particularly how he had contrived to escape from the
prison of Vienne. He informed the Judges, that he
had only passed two nights there; that the Vibailly,
De la Cour, was well disposed towards him, he having
been of great service to M. Maugiron, an intimate
friend of the Vibailly, who had ordered the gaoler to use
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
him well, and allow him the freedom of the garden.
Taking advantage of this, he had scaled the wall and
got away in the manner already described, the Vibailly
having taken care that he should not be pursued and
recaptured.</p>

<p>He added that he had intended and even tried in
the first instance to get to Spain, his native country;
but finding the obstacles so many, and fearing arrest at
every moment, he retraced his steps and made his way
to Geneva, purposing to proceed to Italy.</p>

<p>Questioned further about the printing of the ‘Restitutio
Christianismi,’ he said it had been thrown off to
the extent of 1,000 copies, of which the publisher had
sent a bale to Frankfort in anticipation of the Easter
book-fair of that great mart. This was a piece of information
that was not lost on Calvin. He wrote a
few days after, having meantime gained further information,
to one of the Frankfort members, giving him
intimation of what had been done, telling him where
the packet was bestowed, and recommending its immediate
seizure and destruction, for which he seems
also to have furnished some sort of warrant or authority,
how obtained we are not informed, though it was
probably from Frelon.</p>

<p>Interrogated as to the money he had about him
when imprisoned at Vienne, he replied that his cash
and valuables had not been taken from him on his
arrest there, but were still in his possession when he
reached Geneva.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span></p>

<p>The result of the unwarranted and eventful prosecution
of which he was the subject had thus far been
anything but favourable to the prisoner. The intervention
of Berthelier, above all, may be said to have
been highly prejudicial by bringing Calvin into the
field in person, and supplying him with an additional
motive for urging the suit to the issue that could alone
prove satisfactory to him&mdash;the condemnation capitally
of his insolent, personal, and dreaded theological
opponent, now associated with his political enemies.
Calvin was in truth much too formidable a personage
to be gainsaid on trifling grounds. More than one
member of the Court who might have been disposed
to favour the prisoner, could it have been done without
open defiance of the Reformer, quailed under his glance,
and shrank from the responsibility of opposing him,
when the direction the prosecution had taken came to
be understood. It was even said to be more dangerous
to offend John Calvin in Geneva than the King of
France on his throne! The prisoner whose life was
in debate was a stranger, unknown to the majority of
the Councillors; and it was doubtless thought better
by the timid to leave him to his fate, than to compromise
themselves by taking part with one who on his
own admission entertained opinions adverse not only
to the doctrine of the Church of Geneva, but to all they
had ever had presented to them as characteristic of
the Christian faith. There could be no doubt that the
man was a schismatic, a heretic; and heretic in Geneva
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
meant an opponent of the head of its Church and the
form of Christianity it represented.</p>

<p>Having by this time arrived at a better knowledge
of the state of affairs around him, and more than ever
aware of the possible danger in which he stood; beginning
moreover to feel less confidence in the support
which we may be certain had been privately promised
him, face to face in fact with the man who had already
sought his life and so nearly succeeded in bringing him
to a fiery death, Servetus seems now to have seen the
necessity of changing the somewhat confident tone he
had hitherto maintained in defending his opinions:
reticence takes the place of open assertion, and instead
of any clear avowal or defence of the views he held,
he is now found fencing with the obvious meaning of
the language he has used, and the conclusions to which
it leads, prevaricating too at times; in a word, doing all
in his power to appear not to have written in the way
the charges brought against him show from his works
that he had.</p>

<p>The trial from this time may be said to have acquired
new significance. The private prosecutor and
his bail discharged, and the further conduct of the suit
handed over to the public prosecutor of the city, gave
it additional importance in the eyes of the community
at large, and heightened the interest felt in the issues
involved.</p>

<p>Thrown into fresh hands, proceedings were necessarily
stayed for a few days to give the State Attorney
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
time to get ready his case, so that there was no meeting
of the Court until the 21st. Between this
date and that of the suspension on the 17th, Calvin
is said to have been busy among those of the Council
he reckoned either as friends or not as avowed
antagonists, satisfying their doubts or strengthening
their presumptions of the prisoner’s guilt; showing
them the importance to the cause of religion and
society that he should be convicted; picturing him as
perhaps even less dangerous, if that were possible, on
account of the particular theological grounds set forth,
than as the enemy of all religion, sole foundation, as
he said, of the entire social fabric. The man had been
already tried, convicted, and condemned to death by
the Roman Catholics of Vienne. Would they, the
Senators of Geneva, show themselves less zealous than
the Papists of France in the cause of God and their
own true faith? Surely they would not, but doing
their duty and finding on the evidence, which Calvin
relied on as overwhelming, declare the prisoner guilty
of the heresies laid to his charge.</p>

<p>Whether seen from a Popish or Protestant point of
view, though the matters in debate had no more to do
with real piety, with morality, or the foundations of
society than with the course of the seasons, Servetus
certainly entertained opinions on various topics of transcendental
theology different from those commonly received,
and in so far was a heretic. Of this much
Calvin had no difficulty in satisfying his supporters,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
who consequently felt themselves absolved of any
scruples they might have entertained about condemning
one to death on purely speculative grounds which they
did not even pretend to understand.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a></p>

<p>Although what is said above about Calvin’s private
interference with the course of justice has been questioned,
when we know that he denounced his opponent
from the pulpit in no measured terms, and tampered
with the ministers of the Swiss Churches when they
were consulted on the case, we need not be too
scrupulous in accepting the statement as true. He may
have been alarmed by reports of something like wavering
on the part of certain members of the Court, and
even of questions raised as to the propriety of continuing
a suit involving matters so much out of the
usual course of criminal procedure as known at Geneva,
and the competence of laymen to take such subjects
into consideration at all. Rumours to this effect reaching
his ears may have led him into a course the impropriety
of which in calmer moments he might possibly
have understood. But Calvin was wholly without that
freedom from passion and that sense of relative equity
which go to the constitution of the judicial mind. He
lived in a perpetual imbroglio of quasi-criminal proceedings,
mostly begotten by his own arbitrary legislation;
and he was in the constant habit of interfering in
suits before the Courts of Geneva, less as jurisconsult
than as judge&mdash;as judge, too, in causes so commonly his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
own. Clerical writers who have lauded his comments
on the criminal proceedings of Geneva have not seen
these in their true bearings, or they would have expressed
themselves more guardedly than they have
done.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></p>

<p>That proposals had really been made at the meeting
of the 21st to abandon further proceedings against
the prisoner, though overruled by the majority, seems
to be proclaimed by the resolution then come to, viz.,
‘Inasmuch as the heresies charged against Michael
Servetus appear to be of great importance to Christianity,
resolved to continue the prosecution.’ Such a
resolution, though we have no intimation of that which
led up to it, coupled with Calvin’s activity out of doors,
suffices to show that Servetus had really had a chance
of escape from the grip of his pursuer at this particular
moment. But the occasion passed; and by way of
strengthening themselves in their determination to go
on with the questionable business in which they were
engaged, we now find the Councillors of the Protestant
city of Geneva actually writing to the Popish authorities
of Vienne, and making inquiry of them as to the
grounds on which Michael Servetus of Villanova, physician,
had been imprisoned and prosecuted by them,
and how he had escaped from confinement.</p>

<p>To confirm themselves still further in their purpose
to proceed, it was moreover resolved that the Councils
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
of Berne, Basle, Z&uuml;rich, and Schaffhausen, together
with the ministers of their Churches, should be written
to and informed of what had thus far been done and
was still in progress. In yielding to the instigations
of Calvin, the Court in these last acts is plainly enough
seen to hesitate, and be indisposed to trust entirely to
his guidance. They would have the authorities of the
other Protestant cantons of Switzerland informed of
what was going on, and feel the pulse of their confederates
as to the propriety of proceeding farther, they,
under all the circumstances, being likely to be more
impartially disposed than the Church of Geneva and
its distinguished head.</p>

<p>The Council of Geneva had in fact already had
occasion to know that where simple justice, whether in
the interest of the General or the Individual, was concerned,
Calvin’s lead should not always be too blindly
followed. In the case of Jerome Bolsec, whom Calvin
had arraigned for heresy two years before, against
whom he had used all his influence to secure a conviction,
and in which he would have succeeded (and the
man, almost as much a personal enemy as Servetus,
would have been beheaded) had he not been foiled by
the recommendations of the Swiss Churches and Councils,
which were unanimous in counselling moderation,
the minor Council of Berne even went so far as to
express a distinct opinion against the enforcement of
pains or penalties of any kind in cases of imputed
heresy.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span></p>

<p>But Calvin in his prosecution of those who opposed
him always shows himself both vindictive and
pitiless. Speaking of the way in which he would have
had Bolsec disposed of he says: ‘It is our wish that
our Church should be so purged of this pestilence that
it may not, by being driven hence, become injurious to
our neighbours.’ These words will bear one interpretation
only&mdash;Calvin would have had Bolsec put to
death. But he was withstood in his design, and mainly
so by the Church of Berne, the language of which
must have been highly displeasing to him; for the
Reporter, in counselling moderation, says: ‘How much
easier is it to win a man by gentleness than to compel
him by severity;’ and still more displeasing perhaps
was that which follows: ‘It cannot be said of God
that He blinds, hardens, and gives to perdition any
man, without at the same time assuming that it is God
who is the Author of human blindness and reprobation,
and therefore the cause of the sin committed.’ Now
Bolsec’s offence had been in saying that men are not
saved because elect, but are elect because of their
faith. ‘None are reprobate,’ continues the Reporter
from Berne, ‘by the eternal decrees of God, save those
who of their own choice refuse the election freely
offered to all. How shall we believe that God ordains
the fate of men before their birth; foredooming some
to sin and death, others to virtue and eternal life?
Would you make of God an arbitrary tyrant, strip
virtue of its goodness, vice of its shame, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
wicked of the reproaches of their conscience?’ But
this is to cut the ground from under the feet of Calvin.
No wonder, therefore, that as the proud man would
not, and the self-satisfied man could not, bring himself
to admit his error, he would have had him who exposed
and led to such an exposition of it put out of
the way.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a></p>

<p>It was whilst expecting replies from Vienne, and
waiting the convenience of M. Rigot, the Attorney-General,
that the Court proceeded to make inquiries of
the prisoner concerning his relations with Arnoullet,
the printer of the ‘Restoration of Christianity,’ a letter
of his to a friend of the name of Bertet having now
been put in and read to the Court. In this letter,
dated July 14, 1553, Arnoullet informs his friend Bertet
that he is still in prison, but is promised his liberty
next week, having got six substantial sureties for his
good behaviour in time to come. He had been
villainously deceived, he says, by his manager Geroult,
who corrected the rough proofs of the book, but never
said a word of the heresies it contained.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘I asked him,’ the letter proceeds, ‘whether it was all according
to God? And he replied that it was; and further, that
it contained a number of Epistles addressed to Mons. Calvin,
which he was minded to translate into French. But this I
forbade&mdash;without the permission of the author, which was refused.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
When last in Geneva, Geroult saw and informed
M. Calvin that I had lately been there, without having waited
on him. The truth is, that I did not think he would have
me in such friendship now as in times past&mdash;by reason of my
having had anything to do with such a monster, whom God
look after! Geroult was in fact in league with the writer,
and never let fall a syllable to me until after your departure
for Frankfort [in charge of the Bale of the “Christianismi
Restoratio” among other book merchandise]. This, as you
know, gave occasion to your speaking to me so seriously as
you did about the book in question.</p>

<p>‘As to what you say about my sending someone else to
Frankfort,&mdash;understand me, that I will have no one go but
yourself, and that you are to see every copy of the book destroyed,
so that there shall be left of it neither a leaf nor half
a leaf. Understand, too, that this is to be done without prejudice
to anyone. I am only sorry that we have all been
so grossly deceived in the business; but if God, our Father,
leave us the other goods we possess&mdash;more by far than those we
shall destroy&mdash;it will be well. As to what you say of my
having known that Villanovanus had been rejected by the
Christian Churches, and that avarice had something to do
with my having undertaken the work, let it suffice that I deny
this; and our long intimacy must have made you so well acquainted
with me, that you will not doubt I now speak the truth.
How the Inquisitor came to have your name, I cannot tell.
I can only assure you that in all the interrogations to which
I have been subjected by him I never named a living soul; nor
indeed was there ever mention made of you in my hearing....
Be good enough to say to Mons. Calvin that I shall not
be in Geneva again without seeing him; and that if I have
not done my duty towards him in all respects, beg him to find
some excuse for me. He who is the cause of this [meaning
Geroult, doubtless] is now there; and when Monsieur Calvin
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
shall have spoken with me, he will understand the reason of
my saying nothing more at present. Make my respects to
him meantime, and forgive me if I do not now write more
particularly of our affairs.’</p></blockquote>

<p>This letter we see by the date was written either
shortly before or about the time of Servetus’s arrival in
Geneva, whither Geroult, who was a native of the city,
had betaken himself for safety on the arrest of Servetus
and Arnoullet. Bertet, fearing that Arnoullet might
suffer in the estimation of Calvin, seems to have thought
that the best means of exculpating his friend of complicity
with the writer of the heretical book was now
to show the letter he had lately received from Vienne
to Calvin; and he, we must conclude, laid it forthwith
before the Court, with no purpose assuredly of aiding
the prisoner in his defence. Arnoullet’s letter in exculpation
of himself goes far, as we see, to compromise
Geroult; and he being at this time in Geneva, his
liberty, perhaps even his life, was brought into
danger.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></p>

<p>The letter to Bertet being shown to the prisoner,
he averred that he could not take it upon him to say
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
whether it was from Arnoullet or not, he never having
seen any of the publisher’s handwriting; he said, however,
that it certainly was at Arnoullet’s establishment
that the ‘Christianismi Restitutio’ was printed, and
that Arnoullet had been arrested and imprisoned at
the same time as himself. Arnoullet’s disclaimer of
having known anything of the burden of Servetus’s
book must certainly be untrue. Unless all else we
know in connection with the business be false, he must
have had shrewd suspicions of its nature, and the suppression
of his name as publisher, and of Vienne as the
place of publication, shows that he was not without
misgivings of possible unpleasant consequences following
the appearance of the work were it known that
he had had anything to do with it.</p>

<p>Arnoullet’s letter gave Calvin a hint which he did
not fail to improve upon; for he too wrote to Frankfort
informing his friends, the Protestant ministers
there, of the bale of Servetus’s books that had been sent
to their city&mdash;by Frelon, as I believe, not by Robert
Etienne, the bookseller of Geneva, as has been said,<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a>&mdash;recommending
its seizure and the destruction of its
contents.</p>

<p>Calvin begins his letter thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘I doubt not you have heard of Servetus, the Spaniard,
who more than twenty years ago infected Germany with a
villainous book, full of sacrilegious error of every kind. The
scoundrel having fled from Germany and lain concealed in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
France under a false name, has lately concocted a second book
out of the contents of the first, but replete with new figments,
which he has had printed clandestinely at Vienne, a town not
far from Lyons. Of this book we learn that many copies
have been sent to Frankfort, in prospect of the approaching
Easter fair. The printer, a pious and respectable person,
when he came to know that the book was a mere farrago of
Errors, suppressed the copies he had on hand. It were long
did I enumerate the many Errors, the prodigious blasphemies
against God, that are scattered over its pages. Imagine to yourselves
a rhapsody made up of the impious ravings of every age;
for there is no kind of impiety which this wild beast from hell
has not appropriated. You will assuredly find in every page
matters that will horrify you. The author is now in prison
here at the instance of our magistracy, and I hope will shortly
be condemned and punished. But you are to aid us against
the further spread of such pestiferous poison. The messenger
[the bearer of this] will tell you where the books are bestowed
and their number; and the bookseller to whom they are consigned
will, I believe, make no objections to their being given
to the flames. Did he throw any obstacle in the way of this,
however, I venture to think you are so well disposed, that you
will take steps to have the world purged of such noxious corruption.
You shall not want authority, indeed, for what you
do in the business. If you are allowed to have your way, it
will not then be necessary to seek the interference of your
magistrates. But I have such confidence in you, that I feel
persuaded my hint will suffice to guide your action. The
matter, nevertheless, is of such moment, that I entreat you,
for Christ’s sake, not to allow the occasion of showing yourselves
zealous in your office to pass unheeded.</p>

<p class="author">
‘Farewell, &amp;c.</p>

<p>‘Geneva, 6 Calends of September, 1553.’</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span></p>

<p>The session of the 21st, preliminaries ended, was
occupied in the beginning with a dispute between
the prisoner and Calvin, who came into Court on this occasion
again accompanied by a number of ministers, his
colleagues, introduced, says the Record of proceedings,
to maintain the contrary of the prisoner’s allegations in
respect of the authorities he cites as favouring his
views. Calvin thereupon, taking the lead, proceeded
to interpret the passages of the Fathers referred to by
the prisoner in a sense different from that put upon
them by him, and showed satisfactorily that the word
Trias or Trinity had really been used by writers before
the date of the Nic&aelig;an Council.</p>

<p>It was on this occasion, as we learn from Calvin,<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a>
that on a copy of Justin Martyr being produced by him
in support of his statement, Servetus expressed a wish to
see a Latin translation as well as the original Greek,
a slip which Calvin did not fail to turn to the prisoner’s
disadvantage, for knowing that there was no Latin
translation of Justin, he immediately challenged the
prisoner with being ignorant of Greek. ‘Look’ee,’
says he in his <i>D&eacute;claration pour maintenir la vraie
foy</i>, ‘this learned man, this Servetus, who plumes himself
on having the gift of tongues, is found to be about
as much able to read Greek as an infant to say the A.
B. C. ‘Seeing himself thus caught’ continues Calvin,
‘I took occasion to reproach him with his impudence.
What means this, said I? The book has not been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
translated into Latin, and you cannot read Greek. Yet,
you pretend you are familiar with Justin. Tell me, I
pray you, whence you have the quotations you produce
so freely as if you had Justin in your sleeve? But he
with his front of brass, as was his wont, though he had
leapt from the frying pan into the fire&mdash;<i>sauta du coq &agrave;
l’&acirc;nc</i>&mdash;quite unabashed, gave not the slightest sign of
feeling shame.’ No one, however, who has been at the
pains to look into the works of Servetus will doubt for
a moment that he was not only a competent Greek
scholar, but well advanced in the Hebrew also, with
both of which languages he shows that he was even
critically acquainted. Seeing himself beaten on the
occurrence of the word Trinity in the Greek of Justin,
he may have thought to find a makeweight in a Latin
translation against the original produced by Calvin.
There is indeed an ample display both of erudition
and linguistic accomplishments even in Servetus’s first
work, the seven books on Trinitarian Error.</p>

<p>Another and still more significant discussion now
arose between the Reformer and the prisoner&mdash;and in
these ever-recurring debates we see the persistency with
which Calvin stuck to his opponent&mdash;as to the sense in
which the expression Son of God was to be understood.
Servetus maintained that it was not properly
applied to him who bore it until the moment of his
birth. Calvin, on the contrary, insisted that in conformity
with the usual interpretation of the first chapter
of the Gospel according to John, the authority of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
Creeds and the teaching of the Churches, the words
must be held to refer to the Divine Word which became
incarnate in Jesus Christ, having until then been a
distinct subsistence in the essence of God from Eternity.
In reply to this, Servetus explained and said that the
common interpretation of the language of John was
mistaken; the Son, as he declared, having only existed
<i>formally</i> or as an idea, dispensation or mode in the
mind of God previous to the Incarnation and Birth of
Christ, not as an entity&mdash;a <i>person</i>, in the usual acceptation
of the word, possessed of distinct individual
existence.</p>

<p>Speaking authoritatively now and as from himself,
Calvin rejoined that if the Word had not been a distinct
<i>reality</i> in the essence of God, it could not have united
itself as such with the humanity of Christ; that the
body of Christ must then have been wholly of the substance
of God; and being so&mdash;not being perfect man
as well as perfect God&mdash;the redemption of mankind
could not have been effected by his death. Why the
impossibility, thus assumed, is not said. But let us
pause an instant and think of one pious man tried for
his life by another pious man, on grounds such as
these!&mdash;grounds on which neither the one nor the other
could find footing for a moment.</p>

<p>Without opposing his prosecutor by urging his
own views more particularly at this stage, Servetus
now requested that he might be furnished with the
books necessary to him in his defence, and have pens,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
ink, and paper supplied to him, with which to write a
petition to the Council. Calvin on this agreed to leave
the volumes he had brought into Court in the hands
of the prisoner, and the Judges ordered that any others
he required should be purchased for him at his proper
cost. The jailer finally was directed to supply him
with writing materials; the paper, however, being
limited to a <i>single sheet</i>! and to see particularly to his
being kept secluded&mdash;indication in either case, we
must presume, that the prisoner was believed not to
lack friends or prompters from whom Calvin thought
it would be well to keep him apart.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span></p>

<h2 id="BOOK_II_CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="center">THE TRIAL IN ITS SECOND PHASE&mdash;<i>continued</i>.</p>

<p>When the Court assembled, on August 23, a series of
articles, embodying what may be characterised as a new
Act of Impeachment, was presented to it by M. Rigot
the Attorney-General, headed as follows: ‘These are
the questions and articles on which the Attorney-General
of Geneva proposes to interrogate Michael Servetus,
prisoner, accused of heresy, blasphemy, and
disturbance of the peace of Christendom.’</p>

<p>The questions and articles now presented differ
materially from those proposed in the first instance by
Calvin in the name of his man, Nicolas de la Fontaine.
These, we have seen, refer almost exclusively
to the speculative theological opinions of Servetus, his
disrespectful treatment of Calvin, and his challenge of
the doctrine preached in the Church of Geneva. The
articles of the Attorney-General bear on matters more
purely personal to the prisoner; on his antecedents;
his relations with the theologians of Basle and Germany;
the printing of his books, more particularly the
last of them, and the fatal consequences that must
follow from its publication; his coming to Geneva, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
so on. Save his views on Infant Baptism, his other
dogmatical opinions are not particularly specified or
brought prominently forward; and his differences with
Calvin and the Church of Geneva are not even hinted
at. The theological element in the prosecution, in a
word, is almost entirely abandoned for denunciations
of the socially dangerous nature of the prisoner’s
doctrines, and his persistence in their dissemination.</p>

<p>In the present mood of the Court, and aspect of
the prosecution, it would almost seem that had Servetus
been guilty of nothing more than offences in the
region of speculative theology and the use of uncivil
language towards Calvin and the Church of Geneva,
his delinquencies would not have put him beyond the
pale of escape from all but punishment of a secondary
or insignificant kind. The Attorney-General’s articles
appear in fact to have been framed under the mistaken
idea that Servetus, through the whole course of his life,
had been an immoral and so a dangerous and turbulent
spirit, of the kind with which he was himself, perhaps,
but too familiar in the City of Geneva. He did not,
any more than Calvin and the other Reformers, think
of Servetus as he was in truth&mdash;a speculative, yet perfectly
pious scholar, intent on bringing the Reformation
of Christian doctrine, begun by Luther, still nearer
to the simplicity of Apostolic, or even of pre-Apostolic,
times; for Michael Servetus had the mind to see and
to say that there was a Christian Religion, based on
love of God and man, with added faith in its Author,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
before there were any Gospels; so that these are truly
but the varying and often discrepant reports of the
Master’s teaching, with mythological accretions and
interpolated Greek philosophoumena.</p>

<p>Rigot appears from his articles, which have no look
of having been dictated by Calvin, to have regarded
Servetus as one whose efforts from first to last had
been directed to the confusion of society through the
teaching of an immoral doctrine and the example of
a dissolute life. To force an avowal of so much from
the lips of the prisoner himself was therefore the main
drift of the Attorney’s interrogatories. Must not the
prisoner be aware, said he, that his teaching gives
licence to youth to overflow in debauchery, adultery,
and other social crimes, as he maintains that there is
neither sin nor misdemeanour in such misdeeds, and
no punishment due to them under the age of twenty
years? Why had he not himself entered into the holy
state of matrimony? Had he not studied the Koran
and other profane books for arguments in favour of
Jews, Turks, and the like, and to controvert the
doctrines of all the Christian Churches? Had he
not been imprisoned elsewhere than at Vienne through
having been guilty of various crimes and misdemeanours?
Had he not been a party to quarrels in which he
had wounded another as well as been wounded himself?
If he had not led a dissolute and immoral life, showing
neither care nor zeal for all that became a Christian,
what could have induced him to treat adversely so much
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
that lies at the root of the Christian Religion? Had
he not come, in fact, to Geneva with a view to spread
his doctrines and to trouble the Church as there established?
With whom had he had communication
since he came? Had he not spoken with William
Geroult, and was not Geroult aware of his intention to
come to Geneva? and so on, in the same strain, the
questions amounting to as many as thirty.</p>

<p>But this was ground on which Servetus felt himself
secure; he could reply to all that was asked of him
now with a clear conscience, and without reticence or
prevarication. He had nothing to hide in his past life.
No moral delinquency had been laid to his charge, and
though he may have had a squabble with the Faculty
of Paris, the doctors were notoriously a contentious
crew, always quarrelling among themselves, though
they never, like the theologians, went the length of
burning one another. There was little, therefore, to
be said on that head; for the rest, he had lived
soberly, honourably, industriously; earning his bread
in the sweat of his brain, and for the last twelve or
fourteen years had been incessantly engaged in the
practice of his profession, neither using the sword nor
the spear, but salving the bruises and stanching the
wounds that men in their madness inflict on one
another, and nobly ministering to the yet longer list
of ills in the shape of fevers, fluxes, consumptions,
apoplexies, cancers, dropsies, &amp;c., &amp;c., that waylay us
on our course and give us rest at length.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span></p>

<p>The task which the public Prosecutor had set
himself of showing up Servetus as an ill-conditioned
and quarrelsome person, as a debauchee and evil-liver,
and in the imputed licentiousness and irregularities of
his life to find a motive for his attack on the dogmas
of the Christian faith, was, therefore, a complete failure.</p>

<p>The Attorney-General of Geneva did not imagine,
as it seems, that the man who differed in his speculative
theological opinions from the masses, who follow
their leaders like sheep, could be other than an enemy
to both God and man.</p>

<p>All the charges in the direction now taken, unsupported
as they were by a shadow of evidence, fell to
the ground. Servetus could say with truth that he was
no disturber of the peace&mdash;had never in the whole
course of his life provoked a personal quarrel, and if
he had once drawn his sword, as hinted, it was not as
aggressor, but in self-defence. By physical constitution
he said he was indisposed to matrimony; his not
having entered into that holy state being, as we have
seen, one of the items laid to his charge! Far from
having failed in chastity of life, he declared that he
had been ever studious of Scripture precepts on the
subject, and was even bold enough to think that he
had always lived as a Christian. And truly and in so
far as aught to the contrary was made to appear in the
course of the protracted and searching trial to which
he was subjected, Servetus must be held to come out
stainless. The logical conclusion, however, that speculative
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
theological opinions, whether in conformity with
or adverse to accredited systems of belief, had no influence
one way or another on man’s moral conduct,
was lost upon Calvin and his age; and the vulgar
world of to-day cannot yet be said to have bettered
their opinion.</p>

<p>The prosecution, losing ground the longer it continued
on this tack, reverted to what for it was the
surer course&mdash;the assumed danger to the cause of society
and the peace of Christendom from the publication
of books having the character ascribed to those
written by the prisoner. In spite of all the warnings
he had had, said Mr. Attorney Rigot, the kind and
repeated admonitions of learned theologians, sole
authorities on such subjects, and the unanimous condemnation
his first publication had encountered, he
not only continued to adhere to his errors, but with a
view to spread them farther had written and printed a
second, which was in fact but a reproduction and enlarged
edition of the first.</p>

<p>To this Servetus answered that he thought he
should have offended God had he not done so; ‘he
had acted,’ he said, ‘with as perfect sincerity as if his
salvation had been in question.’ ‘Our Lord,’ he continued,
and quoting the tenth chapter of Matthew,
‘commands us to speak in Light that we have
been told in Darkness; and in the fifth chapter, the
Evangelist says further that we are not to put the
Light we have under a bushel, but to set it where it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
may be seen of all.’ Taking God and his conscience
for guides, therefore, he thought he was but following
the injunctions of the Scriptures and the ancient
Doctors of the Church in all he had written, nor does
he now think that he has done amiss, for his intentions
were good; and, as the Evangelist already quoted
(ch. v.) declares: ‘If the eye be single then is the
whole body full of Light,’ he therefore believes that
his intention having been good, the deed which followed
must be accounted good also. As to the printing
of the book entitled ‘The Restoration of Christianity,’
he had no regrets. He had written and had
it printed because he hoped to bring back to its primitive
meaning much that he thought was erroneous
in current interpretations of Christian Doctrine; his
title of itself showed that he intended <i>the Restoration,
not the Destruction</i>, of Christianity, with which he had
been charged. With all this, however, he did not presume
to say that they who had written before him, and
in a different sense, understood nothing of the Christian
Religion; he only thought they had misconceived
and misconstrued some things, they especially who had
formulated their opinions subsequently to the date of
the Council of Nic&aelig;a.</p>

<p>To the particular charge that he had spoken of the
Doctrine taught in the Reformed Churches as being
nowise Christian, and condemned all who did not think
with himself, he replied that he never imagined that
the Churches of Geneva and Germany were doomed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
to perdition because of their teaching; he only thought
their ministers mistaken on some things.</p>

<p>At this point, a private letter addressed by the prisoner
to Abel Poupin, one of the Ministers of Geneva,
written many years before, was produced and read to
the Court. Whence it came, or how it was obtained, is
not said; but as highly characteristic of the writer, and
foreshadowing the fate that was to befal him, it must
have a place in our story.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Monsieur Abel!&mdash;Although it is most plainly shown, in
my twelfth letter to Calvin, that the Law of the Decalogue
had been abrogated, I shall add a few words that you may
the better understand the innovation brought about by the
advent of Christ. If you turn to Jeremiah xxxi., verse 31
<i>et seq.</i>, you will find it stated distinctly that the law of the
Decalogue was to be annulled. The prophet teaches that the
Covenant entered into with the Fathers, when they left Egypt,
was to be no longer in force. But this was the Covenant of
the Decalogue. For in <small>I</small> Kings, chapter viii., it is said that
the Covenant or Testimony&mdash;the Decalogue, to wit&mdash;was in
the Ark with the Fathers at their exodus from Egypt, whence
the Ark is called the Ark of the Covenant, that is of the
Tables, or Ten Commandments of the Law. Now this was
the form of the Covenant: God promised the Israelites that
they should be his people, if they did according to the words
of the Law, and they on their part engaged that they would
obey them. Such was the Covenant. And it is of this
Covenant that Jeremiah (chapter xviii.) speaks as being repealed,
as does Ezekiel (chapter xvi.), and Paul likewise in
his Epistle to the Hebrews. If God took us for his own
under that Law, we should lie under the curse, and perish by
its pressure. The Law therefore was repealed. God does
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
not now receive us as his children but by faith in his beloved
Son, Jesus Christ. See then what becomes of your Gospel
when it is confounded with the Law. Your Gospel is without
the One God, without true faith, without good works. For the
One God you have a three-headed Cerberus; for faith a fatal
dream, and good works you say are vain shows. Faith in
Christ is to you mere sham, effecting nothing; Man a mere
log, and your God a chim&aelig;ra of subject-will. You do
not acknowledge celestial regeneration by the washing with
water, but treat it as an idle tale, and close the kingdom of
heaven against mankind as a thing of imagination. Woe to
you, woe, woe!</p>

<p>This, my third Epistle, is addressed to you with the wish
that you may be brought to better thoughts, and I mean not
to admonish you any more. It offends you, perchance, that I
meddle in those battles of the angel Michael, and seek to
bring you into the strife. But study the part I refer to carefully,
and you will see that there are men who do battle there,
exposing their lives for Christ’s sake. That the Angels
speak truth is proclaimed by the Scriptures. But see you
not that the question is of the Church of Christ fled from
Earth these many years? Is it not of division, of difference
that John himself makes mention? And who is the Accuser
challenging us with transgression of the Law and its precepts?
Accusation and seduction of the world, he says, were
to precede the battle; the battle therefore was to follow, and
the time is at hand, as he also tells us. And who are they
who shall gain the victory over the Beast? They who do
not accept his mark. I know for sure that I shall die in this
cause; but my courage does not fail me because of this; I
shall show me a disciple worthy of my master.</p>

<p>I much regret that, through you, I am not allowed to
amend some places in my writings now in Calvin’s hands.
Farewell, and look for no more letters from me.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span></p></blockquote>

<p>I stand to my post and meditate, and look out for what
may further come to pass. For come it will, surely it will
come and that without long delay.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></p>

<p>This remarkable letter, interesting in so many respects,
is unfortunately without a date; it is the last of
three he had written, however, and must have been
produced either in 1546, or early in 1547. Highly
characteristic of the self-confidence and assurance of
the writer, we see him as ready to challenge the
Reformers as they were eager to denounce him. He
does not call them heretics and blasphemers, it is true,
nor does he speak of having them punished for the
mistaken views they entertain; and therein he shows
himself their superior. Crying woe upon them for
their errors, he never hints at the propriety of burning
them alive, though he is not blind to the great
probability of being subjected himself to a fate of the
kind.</p>

<p>The letter to Abel Poupin, said Servetus to his
Judges, contains scholastic disputations on difficult subjects,
in the course of which controversialists make use
of strong language with no purpose but to enforce their
views or bring their opponents to the same way of
thinking as themselves, and not because they believe
them to be lost souls by reason of the dissimilar
opinions they entertain. For himself, he continues, he
had had more objectionable terms of reproach applied
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
to him, than any he had used to others; and these not
by word of mouth or in private letters like his own, but
through printed books both in the French and Latin
tongues. What he had written to M. Abel, now more
than six years ago, was with no view to publicity,
but simply to elicit the truth&mdash;certainly with no intention
of slandering the Republic of Geneva and its
Churches.</p>

<p>On the important question of baptism, he admitted
being of opinion that they who were baptized in their
infancy were not truly baptized; but added, that if it
were shown him he was mistaken in this, he was ready
to amend and ask forgiveness.</p>

<p>The prosecutor reverting to the book lately printed
and asking the prisoner if he did not think it was calculated,
through the doctrine it taught, to bring great
troubles on Christendom? he replied that he did not
think his book calculated to introduce dispute or difference
among Christians; on the contrary, he thought
it would be found profitable, and give occasion to the
better spirits among men to speak better things; and
the truth, once admitted and proclaimed by the few,
would by and by spread to the many.</p>

<p>Challenged with having come to Geneva to disseminate
his doctrines and sow dissension among the
Churches, he gave sufficient reason for his presence
among them when he said that he had only come on
his way to Italy, having been turned from his first intention
of trying to reach his native country, after his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
escape from the prison of Vienne, through fear of
arrest by the police of France.</p>

<p>It is but fair to infer, as M. Albert Rilliet observes,
that the present bearing of Servetus, and the
moderation and pertinence of his replies to all the questions
put to him, must have made a favourable impression
on the Court. He was not now confronted with
Calvin, in whose presence he seemed to lose all self-control,
neither was he pressed upon questions of
speculative theology, upon which he either dared not
declare himself openly, or, if he did, was at once in
opposition to all his Judges knew of religion. In Rigot
as his questioner he had nothing more than an officer
discharging a public duty, not the hostile partisan he
had encountered in Colladon who, as agent of Calvin,
may have thought it incumbent on him to give the
most unfavourable turn to everything capable of being
construed to the advantage of the prisoner. The good
impression presumed could hardly fail to be strengthened
by the petition of the prisoner addressed to the
Court and read on the next day of the trial, August 24,
to this effect:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center"><i>To the most honourable my Lords, the Syndics and Councillors
of Geneva.</i></p>

<p>The Petition of Michael Servetus, now lying under a
criminal charge, humbly showeth&mdash;That it is a thing new
and unknown to the Apostles, Disciples, and ancient Churches,
to make the interpretation of the Scriptures, and questions
thence arising, grounds of criminal accusation. This is clearly
seen from Chapters xviii. and xix. of the Acts of the Apostles,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
where accusers are referred to the Churches, when the matters
in question bear upon Religion only. So too in the time of
Constantine, when the Arian heresy was broached, and accusations
were brought on the part both of Athanasius and
Arius, the great Emperor, by his Council and the Councils of
the Churches, decided that, according to the old doctrine,
suits of the kind could not be entertained by civil tribunals&mdash;not
even in the case of such notorious heresy as that of
Arius,&mdash;but were to be taken into consideration and decided
by the Church. Further, that heretics were either to be
brought to reason by argument, or were to be punished by
banishment, when they proved refractory and refused to
amend. Now that banishment was the award of the ancient
Churches against heretics can be proved by a thousand
histories and authorities. Wherefore, my Lords, in consonance
with Apostolic teaching and the practice of the
ancient Church, your petitioner prays that the Criminal
Charge under which he lies may be discharged.</p>

<p>Secondly, my Lords, I entreat you to consider that I have
committed no offence within your territory; neither, indeed,
have I been guilty of any elsewhere: I have never been seditious,
and am no disturber of the peace. The questions I
discuss in my works are of an abstruse kind, and within the
scope and ken of men of learning only. During all the time
I passed in Germany, I never spoke on such subjects save
with Œcolampadius, Bucer, and Capito; neither in France
did I ever enter on them with anyone. I have always disavowed
the opinions of the Anabaptists, seditious against the
magistrate, and preaching community of goods. Wherefore,
as I have been guilty of no sort of sedition, but have only
brought up for discussion certain ancient doctrines of the
Church, I think I ought not to be detained a prisoner and
made the subject of a criminal prosecution.</p>

<p>In conclusion, my Lords, inasmuch as I am a stranger, ignorant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
of the customs of this country, not knowing either how
to speak or comport myself in the circumstances under which
I am placed, I humbly beseech you to assign me an Advocate
to speak for me in my defence. Doing thus, you will assuredly
do well, and our Lord will prosper your Republic.</p>

<p>In the City of Geneva, the 22nd day of August, 1553.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="smcap">Michael Servetus</span>,<br />
In his own cause.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>This well-worded, and in its demands most reasonable
address, strange to say, received no notice beyond
an order to the clerk of the Court to enter it on the
minutes; the prisoner being at the same time curtly
admonished to go on answering the questions addressed
to him. But how hardly the poor man was being used
by his self-constituted Judges we shall see by the tenor
of the next petition he addressed to them. He had
been thrown into one of the foul cells or dungeons
appropriated to criminals of the vilest class, accused
of crimes against person and property; and there, in
addition to mental anguish, he had to suffer all the bodily
miseries that filth, foul air, cold and vermin inflict.</p>

<p>The feeling evinced of late by the Court, in the
prisoner’s favour, appears now to have extended to the
town; the liberal party, the native Genevese, opposed
to Calvin, making of his prosecution of the solitary
stranger a handle against him; his friends on the contrary
speaking of it as proclaiming him the undaunted
defender of the cause of God and religion! The trial
we therefore see had become the occasion of alarm to
one political party in the state, of hope to another, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
of peculiar significance to both. Under present circumstances,
matters proceeding in nowise to his satisfaction,
Calvin must come again to the front; and we
have it on unquestionable authority that it was at this,
the very crisis in the fate of Servetus, that the Reformer
was guilty of the crying injustice of availing himself of
his pulpit, and in the face of numerous congregations
denouncing and vilifying his opponent in no measured
terms, exposing his unorthodox opinions in their most
glaring and repulsive aspects, proclaiming what he
characterised as their impious, blasphemous, demoralising
nature, and thundering reproaches on the mistaken
sympathy that had lately begun to be entertained for
the author of such infamies. By right or by wrong
Calvin was resolved that his old theological enemy,
now turned, as he believed, into their tool for his humiliation
by his political opponents, should not escape
him.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span></p>

<h2 id="BOOK_II_CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="center">THE TRIAL CONTINUED&mdash;THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL RECEIVES
FRESH INSTRUCTIONS FOR ITS CONDUCT.</p>

<p>In the course of this extraordinary trial there seems
never to have been the slightest difficulty made about
shifting the grounds of the Accusation. The particulars
on which the prisoner was interrogated were
scarcely the same in all respects on any two successive
days, and often wide as the poles asunder of the proper
articles of impeachment produced against him. The
petition just presented by the prisoner was thus, without
scruple as without challenge, now made the ground
of a series of questions and harangues by the prosecutor,
studiously calculated to prejudice him in the eyes
of his Judges.</p>

<p>Rigot had in fact made a great mistake in his own
articles of inculpation. The prisoner, as it seemed, was
even likely to escape through his mismanagement;
but, otherwise advised, and as if to make amends for
the line he had taken at first, he now showed himself
either indisposed or afraid to follow further the dictates
of his own more equitable nature. He had been in
conclave with Calvin and received fresh instructions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
from him, as Servetus affirmed without being contradicted.
Rigot, in truth, was no longer free, but cowed
by the stern resolve of the man of mind and iron will.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></p>

<p><i>August 28.</i>&mdash;Abandoning the moderate tone he
had hitherto observed, and taking the petition of the
prisoner for his text, Rigot now entered on the task
prescribed him of showing that the early Christian
Emperors, contrary to the allegation in the petition,
did take cognisance of heresy, and by their Laws and
Constitutions consigned all who denied the doctrine of
the Trinity to death. ‘But the prisoner,’ said Rigot,
‘his own conscience condemning him and arguing him
deserving of death, would have the magistrate deprived
of the right to punish the heretic capitally. To escape
such a fate it is that he has now put forward the false
plea that for false doctrine the guilty are never to be
summarily punished. Not to seem to favour the errors
of the Anabaptists, moreover, ever rebellious against
the authority of the magistrate, it is that the prisoner
in his petition now pretends to repudiate their doctrines;
yet can he not show a single passage in his
writings in which he reprobates their principles and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
practices.’ All this was obviously most unfair to the
prisoner. He was certainly opposed to infant baptism,
and in so much agreed with the Anabaptists; but, far
from declaring himself inimical to the constituted authorities
of the state, he is emphatic in proclaiming the
necessity of upholding them in the exercise of their
lawful authority, and on the duty incumbent on subjects
to obey.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></p>

<p>‘The further allegation of the prisoner,’ continued
the public prosecutor, still harping on the petition,
‘that he never communicated his opinions to anyone,
is manifestly false; for here we have had him saying
that he should think he offended God did he not
impart to others that which God had revealed to him.
How shall we believe that, for the thirty years during
which he has been engaged in elaborating and printing
his horrible heresies, he has never communicated a
word of them to anyone? Bethink ye, that he began
at the age of twenty&mdash;an age when young people invariably
communicate their views and opinions to one
another, their friends and fellow-students&mdash;and by this
judge of the kind of conscience the man puts into his
answers with a view to abuse justice&mdash;as if he repented
in any way of his horrible misdeeds! for though now
saying that he is ready to submit to correction and ask
pardon, he again and far oftener audaciously maintains
that he has said nothing and done nothing amiss.’</p>

<p>Whether influenced by Calvin, to whose party in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
the State Rigot appears to have belonged, or involved
in the suit, and believing it his duty to do all in his
power to obtain the conviction of the prisoner, we see
him now speaking as if he were intimately persuaded
of Servetus’s culpability, and even looking on him as
already condemned; hence the indignation with which
he repels the petitioner’s request to have Counsel to
assist him in his defence. This, indeed, was a demand
that could by no means be granted without taking the
case from the criminal category in which it had been
placed by Calvin from the first. It is not so very long
since the felon or the incriminated for felony among
ourselves was denied the advantage of Counsel, and we
are not to wonder at the same rule obtaining in the
Republic of Geneva more than three hundred years
ago.</p>

<p>Had Servetus succeeded in obtaining Counsel, he
could not, by the laws of Geneva, have been dealt with
capitally; and this would not have met the views of
Calvin, it being impossible in his opinion adequately to
punish the crime of which he held the man had been
guilty by any infliction short of death. Rigot therefore
became eloquent on the petitioner’s insolence, as he
called it, in asking for Counsel to aid him in his defence.
‘Skilled in lying as he is,’ said M. Rigot, ‘there is no
reason why he should now demand an advocate. Who
is there indeed,’ he proceeds, ‘who would or who could
consent to assist him in his impudent falsehoods and
horrible propositions? It has not yet come to this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
that such seducers as he have been allowed to speak
through Counsel; and then there is not a shadow of
the simplicity that might seem to require assistance
of the kind. Let him therefore be disabused of any
hope he may have conceived that so impertinent a
demand can for a moment be entertained, and ordered
to reply by yea or nay to the further questions to be
put to him.’ Rigot, we might fancy, must have thought
that artful lying was a principal part of a counsel’s
duties to his client.</p>

<p>Descending to further particulars suggested by the
petition, the prisoner was asked, ‘On what grounds he
rested the statement he makes concerning the judgment
of heretics in the ancient church?’ To which he
answered: ‘On the histories we have of Constantine
the Great.’ ‘In the course of his law studies at
Toulouse, however,’ said the prosecutor, ‘the prisoner
must have made acquaintance with the code of Justinian,
with the chapters in particular which treat of the Trinity,
of the Catholic Faith, and of Heresy and Apostacy, in
which he must know that opinions such as those he
professes are condemned.’ The prisoner replied that ‘it
was now twenty-four years since he had seen Justinian,
and indeed he had never read him save in a cursory
way, as young men at school or college are apt to do;
and then,’ he went on to say, ‘Justinian did not live
in the age of the primitive church, but in times when
many things had become corrupted; when Bishops
had begun to tyrannise and had already made the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
Church familiar with criminal prosecutions.’ To this
most pertinent reply, no answer was attempted.</p>

<p>Reproached with having calumniated the Ministers
of the Word of God as teachers of false doctrine&mdash;which
on his part, said Monsieur Rigot, amounts to a capital
crime&mdash;Servetus admitted that calumny of the kind deserved
the severest punishment, but maintained nevertheless
that in disputation it was common and not
unpardonable for opponents to gainsay one another in
strong language, without being held guilty of calumny
or defamation, and so of deserving punishment by the
civil authorities for what they say.</p>

<p>Referring next to his intercourse with Œcolampadius
and Capito, to whom he had ascribed conformity
with his views, although, said Rigot, he must know
that they were both doctors well approved by the reformed
churches, and consequently could not possibly
be of his mind on the subjects in debate; he replied
‘that consonance in every particular was not universal
either among the Reformers or the reformed churches;
Luther and Melanchthon, for instance, had both of
them written against Calvin on the subject of the
sacraments and free will. Without being in a condition
to prove what he says in his petition, he declares nevertheless
that in conversation with Capito, when they
were private and without other witness than God, he&mdash;Capito&mdash;did
assent to his views. Œcolampadius, he
owned, had withdrawn the approval he seemed to accord
in the first instance.’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span></p>

<p>When we refer to Œcolampadius’s letters,<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> we have
no difficulty in believing what Servetus here asserts to
be the truth. It was only after Servetus had more
thoroughly exposed his opinions in conversation, that
the Reformer of Basle saw the <i>unsoundness</i>, which had
not appeared in the confession of faith sent him at an
earlier period by his correspondent. And here let us
observe that, whilst Œcolampadius is now particularly
cited, nothing is said of Capito, still a Minister in the
Reformed Church. Capito, however, was, as it seems,
not entirely to be relied on in his views of the Trinity,
that stumbling-block in the way of the first Reformers,
so many of whom we have found giving but a half-hearted
assent to the verbal contradictions it involves:
the Reformers could spare one another as it
seems, on the subject, though they had no mercy for
Servetus!</p>

<p>It being objected to the prisoner that he was in
manifest contradiction with himself when he said he
thought he should offend God did he not impart the
doctrine that had been revealed to him; he replied that
what he had stated was his opinion and the truth; not-withstanding
which he had spoken of his views to none
but the doctors of the Reformed Church particularly
named; a course he had followed, indeed, in consonance
with the commandment of our Lord, not to cast
pearls before swine: ‘I would not proclaim myself to
incompetent persons, and I was living among Papists
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
in times when there was active persecution going on
and much cruelty practised.’</p>

<p>The prosecutor now alleged, but as usual without
a tittle of evidence, that the prisoner had had extensive
epistolary relations with Italy, a country in which it
was believed his doctrines had many followers&mdash;a fact,
said Rigot, which it was unlikely he did not know,
and less likely, still, not to improve upon, did he know
it. To this Servetus replied by a simple denial: he
had had no communications with Italy by letter or
otherwise; adding that his only correspondents had
been Œcolampadius, Calvin, Abel Poupin, and F.
Viret, from whom alone the Court had any information
concerning letters of his. Had we no other intimation
of Calvin’s prompting, at this stage of the proceedings,
than the reference now made to the spread
of Antitrinitarian doctrines in Italy, we should feel
assured that it was he who was fighting under the
mask of Rigot, as he had formerly fought under that
of Trie and of De la Fontaine. Rigot was not likely
to know much of the spread of Antitrinitarian views
in Italy, but Calvin was, as we learn distinctly through
the letter of Paul Gaddi to him, which we have quoted.
Calvin, indeed, makes pointed and angry reference to
such a state of things both in his ‘Refutatio Errorum’
and ‘D&eacute;claration pour maintenir la vraie Foy.’</p>

<p>The circumstances connected with the printing of
the ‘Restoration of Christianity’ at Vienne were once
more brought up, the prisoner being particularly questioned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
as to his relations with the publisher Arnoullet
and his manager Geroult. In contradiction to what
he had already admitted on this head, and with the
letter of Arnoullet to Bertet lying open before the
Court, he now averred that he had not had any, even
indirect, communication with Geroult on the subject of
his book! This, we regret to think, must necessarily
be untrue. The difficulty he had had to find a publisher,
as we see by the letter of his friend Marrinus;
the premium he had paid Arnoullet to have the work
undertaken, the secrecy with which the printing had
been carried on, added to other minor terms of the
contract&mdash;that all was to be at his proper cost, that he
was to be his own corrector of the press, &amp;c.&mdash;-everything,
in a word, assures us that both Arnoullet and
Geroult were as well aware of what they were about
as the author himself. Arnoullet, we may be certain,
never intended to appear as either the printer or publisher
of the heretical work. It was to come out in
Italy, in Switzerland, in Germany&mdash;anywhere, everywhere,
save at Vienne, Lyons, or Paris, the principal
emporia of the book trade of France. Neither, indeed,
did Michel Villeneuve, the Physician, intend to show
himself at once as its author. The M.S.V., on the last
page, was a private mark by which the child might be
known and claimed by the parent at some future time,
when his fame had spread over Europe, when he had
been eagerly enquired after by an admiring world,
and raised above the heads of Luther, Melanchthon,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
Œcolampadius and Calvin, as the great ‘Restorer of
Christianity’!</p>

<p>The persistence with which Servetus stuck to the
untruth now uttered is not difficult of explanation:
his first admission of complicity on the part of the
Viennese publisher and his manager was made inadvertently
and without forethought; his retractation
and denial came of reflection and better feeling, when
he saw that the admission was calculated to bring the
two men who had aided him in his undertaking into
the same trouble as himself. In spite of what M.
Rigot says, Michael Servetus never meets us save as
a man of a perfectly guileless nature&mdash;more guileless
perhaps than truthful.</p>

<p>As every point in the several indictments was made
subject of renewed inquiry, so do we now find further
questions addressed to the prisoner on his life and
social habits; for the prosecution, as we have seen,
held it matter of moment to present him, if possible,
as a person of immoral and ill-regulated life. They
had not now, however, any more than formerly, a particle
of evidence to show that he had ever lived otherwise
than soberly, chastely, and respectably; and as
to the allegation, brought up against him for the second
time, that he had said women were not such paragons
of virtue as to make matrimony necessary to secure
their more intimate converse, he declared, as he had
done already, that he had no recollection of ever having
said anything of the kind; but if he had, it was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
by way of bravado, and to conceal a certain infirmity
under which he laboured which indisposed or incapacitated
him, as he believed, from entering on matrimony.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a></p>

<p>Making an abrupt change of front, the prosecutor
now inquired of the prisoner what he meant by the
passage in his book where he says that, ‘The Truth
begins to declare itself and will be accomplished for
all ere long.’ ‘Do you mean that your doctrine is the
Truth, and will shortly be universally received?’ ‘I
mean to speak of the progress of the Reformation,’
said Servetus; ‘the truth began to be declared in the
time of Luther, and has gone on spreading since then
until now.’ Had he stopped here, all would have been
well and the answer must have been scored to his
credit; but he went on to particularise and to say that
‘the Reformation would have to advance upon some
matters which in his opinion were not yet well set
forth.’</p>

<p>This was immediately seized upon as a challenge
by the men who believed that the Reformation had
already been accomplished or completed through them;
so that he was forthwith required to explain what he
meant by such language. Here, however, he dared
not be outspoken; and though he made no denial of
his doctrine, which was seen of all to be in his estimation
the complement and crown of the Reformation, he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
diverged into a variety of topics, floundered, and
wound up by proposing to enlighten the Court by a
reference to the Bible and the Fathers, or to explain
himself more fully than he had done in his book if
they would grant him a conference, in their presence,
with one or more men of learning. Pressed further,
he said that he could not divine whether his doctrine
would ever be generally accepted or not; but he
believed and should continue to believe that it was
founded in truth until shown to be otherwise. ‘Such
things,’ said he in conclusion, ‘are commonly enough
denounced and condemned as erroneous at first, but
are by and by acknowledged for truth and universally
accepted.’</p>

<p>The prisoner had much the same difficulty in justifying
his singular opinion that persons under the age
of twenty were not accountable agents, or incapable of
sin, and so not obnoxious to punishment for their misdeeds.
He, in fact, made but an indifferent escape
from such a paradox by declaring that, in speaking as
he did, he had capital punishment only in view; not
that he thought there should be penalties of no kind
for evil-doers under age. They, he said, might be
properly punished by flogging, seclusion, and the like.
From what he says on another occasion we see that
this fancy of Servetus was founded on a literal and
arbitrary interpretation of the text where Jehovah, to
punish the Israelites, determines that no one over
twenty years of age is to enter the Land of Promise;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
all others are to leave their carcasses in the wilderness.</p>

<p>Having said a few words in his book implying no
disapproval of the infidel Alkoran, the prisoner, in
reply to the reproaches made him for having spoken
without reprobation of such a personage as Mahomet
and his book, now averred that he had only adduced
Mahomet and the Koran to the greater glory of the
Lord Jesus Christ, and even ventured to add: ‘That
though the book generally is bad, it nevertheless contains
good things, which it is lawful to use’&mdash;language
that was looked on as little short of blasphemy by his
auditors, but that to us proclaims the superiority of the
speaker over the bigots around him.</p>

<p>The last question in this day’s proceedings referred
to a sojourn he was said to have made in Italy
immediately before coming to Geneva, and how he
had passed his time since he arrived there. And here
again we find Calvin the prompter; for it is he who
speaks of Servetus having wandered for four months
in Italy before reaching Geneva. Any such journey
or sojourn, however, as that now hinted at, Servetus
positively denied; ‘and for such information as the
Court might require of his doings since he had entered
their city, he referred them to his host of the Rose,
where he had had his quarters before being thrown
into their prison.’ It is not difficult to see the drift of
the latter clause of the question; but Servetus was on
his guard now, and did not commit himself or his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
prompters, the Libertines, as he had done when the
printer of his book was in question.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>August 31.</i>&mdash;After the lapse of three days an
answer was received to the letter addressed by the
Syndics and Council of Geneva to the authorities of
Vienne. In this missive the Genevese were informed
that it was impossible to comply with the request they
had made to have the documents connected with the
trial of Michel Villeneuve sent to them, inasmuch as
the authorities of Vienne could not sanction any
review or possible inculpation of their proceedings.
They therefore only forwarded duplicates of the
warrant of arrest and sentence of death passed upon
the said Villeneuve, and for themselves they demanded
‘the delivery of that individual into their hands, in
order that the sentence passed upon him might be
carried into effect,’ engaging, as they went on to say,
‘that it should be of a sort that would make any
search for further charges against him unnecessary.’<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a></p>

<p>To this communication from Vienne, the Council
ordered a gracious answer to be returned; but they
declined to send back the prisoner, ‘inasmuch as
he was at present under trial before themselves for
matters in which they, too, promised that strict justice
should be done.’ To be sent back to Vienne, Servetus
knew would be to be consigned to certain death at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
the shortest possible notice; so that to the somewhat
needless question now put to him by the Court, their
own expressed determination considered: ‘whether he
preferred remaining in the hands of the Council of
Geneva, or to be sent back to Vienne? he fell on his
knees and entreated to be judged by the Council in
presence, who might do with him what they pleased;
but he begged them in no case to send him back to
Vienne.’ There he knew that the stake was driven,
and the faggots piled, whilst in Geneva, we must
imagine from his bearing, he did not at present fear
that anything of the kind could possibly come into
requisition.</p>

<p>The business of Vienne thus brought into prominence,
the Council proceeded to inquire of the prisoner
concerning the trial there; touching once more on his
escape from the prison, his coming to Geneva, and any
communication he might have had since his arrival in
the city with persons resident therein. On the subject
of the trial and escape he could be open and communicative;
but he denied explicitly that since he reached
Geneva he had spoken with anyone save those who
waited on him and brought him his meals in the hostel
where he lodged&mdash;a denial against the truth of which
more than suspicion may fairly be allowed. But let us
observe that Servetus’s swervings from the absolute
truth are mostly to screen others rather than to save
himself. On the vital question of his religious opinions
be never blenched before his judges of Geneva.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span></p>

<p>It was now that the prisoner mentioned incidentally
the singular fact that the windows of the room he occupied
in the Rose Inn had been nailed up. But why
this was done he did not say; neither, strangely
enough, was any notice taken of it by the Court.
There can be little doubt, however, as we interpret the
matter, that it was to prevent him from taking himself
off without the knowledge of his prompters of the
Libertine party. Realising the full hostility of Calvin,
knowing that his life was aimed at, he was anxious
to be gone; but Perrin and Berthelier had resolved to
keep him and play him off against their tyrant and
the Clericals, reckless of the risk he was thereby made
to run, so as they might use him for their own selfish
ends. Hence the otherwise inexplicable delay of the
month in Geneva before his presence became known
to Calvin&mdash;the fatal delay that cost him his life!</p>

<p>How it happened that Servetus was ever made an
object of interest to the Libertine party, detained as he
certainly was by them in his passage through Geneva,
is a question not altogether irrelevant. That he was
unknown even by name to the chiefs of this party,
and to everyone else resident in Geneva, save Calvin,
seems certain; and Calvin who had not seen his
Parisian acquaintance for nearly twenty years, had no
intimation of his presence there for nearly a month.
But William Geroult, the printer of Vienne, was in
Geneva when Servetus reached the city. Having
heard of his escape from prison, he may have been on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
the look-out for the possible coming of the fugitive.
Geroult, though of the Reformed Faith, we have seen
reason to believe was not among the number of
Calvin’s admirers. But native of Geneva and of the
Libertine party, we venture to think it was through
him that Servetus was made known to Perrin and Berthelier;
such particulars being further communicated
as suggested to them the use that might be made of
the fugitive against their clerical enemy. We have
seen the proceedings of August 23rd concluded by a
number of questions having reference to those with
whom the prisoner might have held communication
since he reached the city, and particularly if he had not
seen and spoken with William Geroult, and if Geroult
did not know that he intended to come to Geneva?</p>

<p>That they might leave no incident in the previous
history of the prisoner unnoticed, the Court now questioned
him on his opinions touching the Mass, which
it was known he had declared to be a mockery and
a wickedness, his habit nevertheless having been to
attend its celebration during his residence at Vienne.
To this, put to him reproachfully, he replied that he
had but imitated Paul, who frequented the synagogue
like the Jews in general, though he had inaugurated
a new religion of his own; but for himself, he added
that he had sinned through fear of death, and regretted
what he had been obliged to do.</p>

<p>Confronted with the gaoler of Vienne, who had
brought the missives of his masters to Geneva, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
asked if he knew the man, he replied that of course
he did, having been under his charge in prison for
two days; but he exonerated the gaoler from all complicity
with his escape. Furnished with a certificate to
this effect, the gaoler was dismissed, and returned to
Vienne.</p>

<p><i>September 1.</i>&mdash;At the sitting on this day a letter
was received from M. Maugiron, Lieutenant-General
of the King of France for Dauphiny, which gave fresh
occasion for recurrence to the affairs of Vienne. In his
letter Maugiron informed the Syndics and Council of
Geneva that the goods and chattels and debts due to
Michel Villeneuve, estimated to amount to 400 crowns,
had been escheated by his Majesty the King, and given
to his&mdash;Maugiron’s&mdash;son; but that to come into possession
it was necessary to have a list of the parties
indebted to the doctor. He therefore requested the
Council to interrogate their prisoner on this head, and
furnish him with a list of the names and surnames of
debtors to the prisoner’s estate, as well as of the sums
severally due by each. The noble correspondent,
Lieutenant of the King of France for Dauphiny, must
have been oblivious of the professional services of the
physician Villeneuve when he consented to write as he
did to the Syndics and Council of Geneva; for we
have seen that Servetus was actually taken from the
house of this Monsieur Maugiron when in attendance
on him, to find himself a prisoner. Anxious to clear
himself of all suspicion of having aided and abetted in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
the evasion from the prison of Vienne, Maugiron goes
on in his letter to express himself ‘rejoiced to know
that Villeneuve is now in the hands of Messieurs de
Geneve, and I thank God,’ he continues, ‘for the assurance
I feel that you will take better care of him
than did the Ministers of Justice of Vienne, and award
him such punishment as will leave him no opportunity
for dogmatising, or writing and publishing heretical
doctrines in time to come.’</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Blow, blow, thou winter wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art not so unkind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As man’s ingratitude!’<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Let us not doubt that the heart of Michael Servetus
swelled with indignation and contempt at this
exhibition of heartlessness and meanness on the part
of the man he had tended in his sickness. The experience
of the physician, however, leads him to form
no very high estimate of the world’s thankfulness for
services in sickness: the fee at the moment is mostly
held to close the account. Sick men are weak; and
when they recover are usually well-disposed to forget
not only their weakness, but the physician who has
seen it.</p>

<p>The appeal made to the self-esteem of the Council
of Geneva, and a possible desire on their part to enter
into rivalry with the judicial tribunal of Vienne, may
have contributed in some measure to the final condemnation
of Servetus. We do not read that they took the
becoming course at once of declining to question the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
prisoner on matters having not even the most remote
connection with the cause; they seem actually to have
tried to elicit information from him, that would have
been of use to M. Maugiron, in making the gift of
his Majesty the King of France of much avail; but
Servetus positively declined to give any information
of the kind desired, as having no bearing on the
matters for which he was now on his trial, and being
likely to distress many poor persons who were
indebted to him.

<h2 id="BOOK_II_CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="center">SERVETUS IS VISITED IN PRISON BY CALVIN AND THE
MINISTERS.</p>

<p>We have seen symptoms of something like a leaning
of the Court towards the prisoner. They had requested
Calvin and others of the Clergy to visit and confer with
him, and do their best to bring him to what all regarded
as a better understanding; and it would appear that
immediately after the last sitting, Calvin, accompanied
by several Ministers, proceeded to the gaol and had an
interview with the prisoner. Calvin of course was the
spokesman, and opened upon him with an address in
which he strove to show him not only the load of error
under which he laboured in his exposition of Scripture
generally, but the grave offence he had committed in
attacking the particular dogma of the Trinity, as interpreted
by the Churches, and in calling all who believed
in it Tritheists and even Atheists.</p>

<p>From what we already know we may divine how
little a visit from John Calvin with such an exordium
was likely to lead to any satisfactory conclusion; Servetus
appears at first, indeed, to have declined even to
hear his visitors: he was too much oppressed by sorrow,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
sickness, and long confinement, he said, to enter on
any defence of his views, and a prison was no fit place
for theological discussion.</p>

<p>Stern, bigoted, and uncompromising as he was by
nature, Calvin would have been false to his calling as
a Minister had he not striven, though thus encountered,
to bring even a personal enemy to what he believed to
be proper thoughts of the Trinity, the nature of the
Logos and the Sonship of Christ; and we do not question
his will and inclination to do so; but in Servetus
Calvin saw the man who had insulted and so had mortally
offended him, whilst in Calvin, Servetus beheld the individual
who so lately, by underhand means and the
violation of his confidential correspondence, had wrecked
his fortunes and sought his life; the man, moreover, at
whose instance he was now in prison and subjected to
what he rightfully regarded as unworthy usage and an
unauthorised and unjust trial.</p>

<p>We can but excuse the irritation that mastered
Servetus now, and lament that with Berthelier’s disastrous
countenance misleading him, he neglected the
chance that was undoubtedly offered him to save his
life, had it been but by a show of moderation and conciliatory
bearing. Calvin, however, must have persevered
for a while with the unfortunate physician, and
brought him to reply to more than one of the principles
of his system produced against him. Among others,
we find him reported as maintaining that wherever the
word <i>Son</i> is met with in the Scriptures, it is the <i>man</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
Jesus that is to be understood; and when <i>Christ</i> is
spoken of as the Word and the Eternal Son, the language
is to be taken in a <i>potential</i> not in an actual
sense; neither Light, Logos, nor Son having existed
otherwise than in the mind of God before creation; the
actual or real Son in particular having only begun to be
when engendered in the womb of the Virgin Mary&mdash;and
so on, the discourse turning upon matters transcending
man’s power to know, and falling wholly within
the domain of faith or belief. On the last topic brought
under review, Servetus from the beginning of his career
was always empathic. ‘Si unum iota mihi ostendas quo
Verbum illud Filius vocetur, aut de Verbi generatione
fiat mentio, fatebor me devictum. Ubi Scriptura dicit
Verbum, dicit et ipse Verbum; ubi Filius, Filius; scilicet:
olim Verbum, nunc vero Filius.’ These are his
words in his earliest work, and from their tenor he
never swerved.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a></p>

<p>The interview ended as we may imagine it could
only end&mdash;with increased irritation on the part of the
Ministers at the obstinate self-will of the heretic, as
they interpreted it, and without a ray of new light
having made its way into the mind either of the prisoner
or his visitors. His would-be enlighteners, however&mdash;he
thinking that they stood much in need of enlightenment
from him&mdash;were particular, before taking their
leave, in insisting on the right of the temporal power
in the state to repress and punish theological error.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
Heretics, as they said, being liable by the Justinian
Code, still in force over Europe, to be proceeded against
and punished as criminals; and he having, in a highly
objectionable manner, attacked many among the most
sacred of the divine ordinances, would have no reason
to complain did he find himself dealt with in the
severest fashion as a blasphemer of the Church of God,
and disturber of the peace of Christendom.</p>

<p>But neither, as we may imagine, were the words
of the deputation in this direction found of any avail
in leading the prisoner to their views. Civil tribunals,
he maintained, were utterly incompetent in matters of
faith, and had no right of the sword in cases of imputed
heresy. The Code of Justinian was in truth no authority,
having been compiled in times when the Church
had already lapsed from its original purity. The
violent repressive measures it sanctioned were wholly
unknown to the Apostles and their immediate successors.
Besides all this, he held the Church of Geneva
to be specially precluded from giving an opinion or
pronouncing a judgment upon his views; his opponent
and personal enemy, Calvin, wielding such paramount
authority there, as to make him in fact and in himself
the Church. How little all this, however true (and all
the less, perhaps, because true), was calculated to win
either Calvin or his followers to more friendly feelings,
may be imagined; but it shows us the brave, consistent,
conscientious, religious man, face to face with fate, and
a proffered opportunity to conciliate and save his life,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
abiding by his convictions, and, with the warning but
just given him, rather than belie himself, verily courting
death. What would have happened had Galileo been
as conscientious and firm as Servetus?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span></p>

<h2 id="BOOK_II_CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="center">THE COURT DETERMINES TO CONSULT THE COUNCILS
AND CHURCHES OF THE FOUR PROTESTANT CANTONS.</p>

<p>It was at this time and on the suggestion of Servetus&mdash;as
Calvin affirms, of the Council, according to its own
minutes&mdash;that a resolution was come to, by which the
Church of Geneva was no longer to have the sole say
in the final decision of the guilt or innocence of the
prisoner. The Councils and the other reformed
Churches of Switzerland, it was resolved, were to be
consulted on the merits of the case. There was a precedent
for such a course; it had been followed only
two years before, under somewhat similar circumstances,
when Jerome Bolsec was tried for heresy at the instance
of Calvin. Calvin and the Ministers were consequently
directed by the Court to extract from the works of the
prisoner, and to deliver in writing, but without note
or comment, the particular passages involving the
erroneous or heretical opinions in debate between the
prosecution and him.</p>

<p>This appeal to the Swiss Churches we cannot help
thinking of as fatal to Servetus. If his own concluding
reply to the deputation which visited him in prison
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
did not lead to it, it was probably suggested to him by
Berthelier, who knew that it had saved Bolsec. But
Berthelier was not theologian enough correctly to appreciate
the dissimilarity of the propositions involved
in the two cases; and he certainly took no note of the
difference in the political circumstances of the several
times, or he would not have given the advice we
presume he did.</p>

<p>From the letters which Calvin now wrote to several
of his friends, particularly to Sulzer, of Basle, we learn
that he was much averse to the idea of this appeal to
the Churches. Having been foiled by them in his
prosecution of Bolsec, he must have feared that what
had happened before might happen again. He knew
that he was less considered abroad than at home, and
seems not to have apprehended that the appeal now
resolved on, was not only to ensure his own triumph,
but to make the Reformed Churches of Switzerland
participators in his sin of intolerance and abettors of
the error (to give it no worse name) he committed
when he brought Servetus to his death.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span></p>

<h2 id="BOOK_II_CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="center">THE TRIAL IS INTERRUPTED THROUGH DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN CALVIN AND THE COUNCIL.</p>

<p>The Churches were to be appealed to, then, and Calvin
applied himself immediately to make the best he
could of the case as it stood. With the diligence that
distinguished him, we need not doubt of his having
been soon ready with the Articles upon which the trial
of Servetus may be said to have entered on its third, if
it were not its fourth and definite, phase.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> But a notable
interval elapsed before we find the Council giving any
heed to the new Articles of Indictment, or taking steps
to have them despatched to the Cantons. The Council
had business of another kind to engage them, with
Calvin and his friends as their opponents on grounds
of policy, instead of their instigators and guides in a
trial for heresy. It was at this precise time that the
struggle to which we have alluded in our review of
the political situation took place between Calvin and
the Council on the right exercised by the Consistory
to excommunicate or deprive of Church privileges
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
those who were known to have infringed one or another
of its arbitrary religious, moral, or sumptuary
regulations. Philibert Berthelier, having offended in
this direction, had fallen under the ban of the Consistory
some time before; but, having now appealed to
the Council for redress against what he held to be an
unjust award, his party were powerful enough not only
to obtain a decision in his favour, but to have the Consistory
deprived of the right to excommunicate at all.</p>

<p>This was felt, of course, as a heavy blow by Calvin
and his supporters. Berthelier, formally absolved of
the Consistorial interdict, was declared at liberty to
present himself at an approaching celebration of the
Solemn Supper. And he would probably have shown
himself there, and an unseemly scene would have ensued;
for Calvin was as resolute to have his authority
respected within the walls of St. Peter’s Church,
as the Council could have been to have theirs upheld
within the precincts of the City. Berthelier himself,
however, being advised that though he was fully
entitled to present himself at the Table, it would
perhaps be as well did he abstain from doing so for
the present, took the hint and stayed away. But
several members of the Libertine party&mdash;each of whom
we must presume, in Calvin’s estimation, might have
subscribed himself as</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Parcus Deorum cultor et infrequens,<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>uninformed of this, and expecting countenance from
the presence of their leader, offered themselves among
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>
the other communicants. Being all well known to
Calvin, however, they were resolutely warned off by
him. Covering the typical Bread and Cup with his
outspread hands, he declared that they should sooner
hack them off than bring him to minister to those he
looked on as notorious scoffers at religion and its most
solemn rites. Here the minister was in his place and
within the pale of his office; so that they who came to
browbeat and humble him had to retreat from his
presence with shame to themselves and damage to
their party, whilst he stood erect in the fearless discharge
of his duty, and rose higher than ever in the
estimation of all lovers of law and order, even of the
stringent kind that prevailed in the theo-autocratic
city of Geneva.</p>

<p>The letter which Calvin wrote, at this stormy
time, to his friend Viret, of Lausanne, is too interesting
and characteristic not to have a place here:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>... I had thought to have been silent about our affairs
of Geneva, fearing that I should only add needlessly to your
other anxieties; but lest rumours reaching you from other
quarters should distress you more than knowledge of the
truth, I think it best to tell you exactly what has happened.</p>

<p>When Ph. Berthelier was forbidden to present himself at the
Lord’s Table some year and half ago, he then appealed to
the Council against the decree of the Consistory. We were
called into court to hold the scoundrel (<i>nebulo</i>) in check; and
when the case had been heard, the Senate declared that he
had been properly excommunicated. From that time until
now he has been quiet; whether in despair of mending
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span>
matters or through indifference, I know not. But now, and
before the Syndicate of Perrin expires, he would have himself
reinstated by the Council in spite of the Consistory. I was
again summoned, and in copious words I showed that this
could with no propriety be done; that it would not be lawful,
indeed, to counteract in any such way the discipline of the
Church. When my back was turned, however, the Consistory
not having been further heard or represented, permission was
given him by the Council to present himself at the Table.
This being told to me, I took care immediately to have the
Syndic summon a special meeting of the Council, at which I
entered with such fulness into the question, as to leave nothing
which in my opinion could be said further to make
them change their mind&mdash;now vehement, now more persuasive,
I strove to bring them to a right way of thinking. I even
declared that I would sooner die, opposing their decree, than
profane the Sacred Table of the Lord.... The Senate
nevertheless replied that they saw no reason to depart from
the judgment already given.</p>

<p>From this you will perceive that I should have nothing
for it but to quit my ministry, did I suffer the authority of
the Consistory to be trodden under foot, and consented to
administer the Supper of Christ to the openly contumacious
who declare that we Pastors of the Church are nothing to
them. But, as I say, I would sooner die a hundred deaths than
subject Christ to so foul a mockery. What I said yesterday
at two meetings, I need not recapitulate. But the wicked
and lost among us will now have all they desire. In so far as
I am concerned, it is the Church’s calamity that distresses me.
If God, however, give such licence to Satan that I am to be
thwarted in my ministry by violent decrees, I am as good as
dead in my office. But he who inflicts the wound will find
the salve; and truly, when I see how the wicked have gone
on all these years with such impunity, the Lord perhaps prepares
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>
some judgment for me, in respect of my unworthiness.
Whatever befals, it is nevertheless for us to submit to his will.
Farewell, and may God be with you always, guide you and
protect you! Pray incessantly that He consider this our
miserable Church!</p>

<h2 id="BOOK_II_CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p class="center">THE TRIAL IS RESUMED ON THE NEW ARTICLES
SUPPLIED BY CALVIN.</p>

<p>It fell out, unfortunately for Servetus, that the decree
of the Council against the Consistory was the immediate
prelude to the resumption of his trial. The decision
come to had been warmly contested by Calvin,
as we see by the preceding letter, he looking on any
interference of the civil magistrate in questions which
he regarded from a purely ecclesiastical point of view,
as a blow not only to his spiritual authority in Geneva,
but to the cause of religion. He saw the late awards
of the Council in favour of Berthelier and against the
Consistory in the light of triumphs of his enemies
over himself, and mainly due to the influence of his
particular opponent, Amied Perrin, under whose presidency
the adverse decisions had been obtained.</p>

<p>On the resumption of the Servetus trial, then,
the hot blood engendered by the recent struggle had
not yet had time to cool; and Calvin, on taking his place
in the reconstituted Criminal Court, found himself
once more not only face to face with his theological opponent,
but set beside his chief political enemies, Perrin
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span>
and Berthelier. Elate with the advantage just gained,
they had kept their seats on the Bench, intending
doubtless to do what in them lay to secure a further
victory through Michael Servetus over the uncompromising
Reformer. It is not difficult to imagine
the influence, in the present state of affairs, which the
attitude of these men had on the fate of our unhappy
Servetus; for Calvin, with his many supporters acting
as his spies, was well informed of the countenance they
had given the prisoner privately, and seems to have
construed their presence at this particular moment as a
public demonstration in his favour. To convict Servetus
was therefore to thwart them, and the discomfiture
of the solitary stranger had become more than
ever a personal and political necessity to the Reformer.</p>

<p>The articles from the works of Servetus from the
‘Christianismi Restitutio’ exclusively, on this occasion,
thirty-eight in number, had been laid before the Court
so long back as September 1, and are headed:
‘Opinions or Propositions taken from the Books of
Michael Servetus which the Members of the Church
of Geneva declare to be in part impious and blasphemous,
in part full of profound errors and absurdities,
all of them alike opposed to the Word of God and
the orthodox assent of the Church.’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>September 15.</i>&mdash;The Court constituted in the usual
manner, with Servetus before them sworn to speak the
truth, Calvin, who seems now to have taken the place
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span>
of the Attorney-General, proceeded to interrogate the
prisoner on the new Articles of Impeachment. One of
the first of these, referring to the relationship of the Son
to the Father in the mystery of the Trinity, appears to
have given rise to another long, and we may imagine
excited debate between Calvin and the prisoner; from
which, however, the judges were able to gather so little
light that they interposed, and came to a resolution to
have any further discussion that might arise carried on
in writing and in the Latin tongue, instead of by word
of mouth and in French as heretofore.</p>

<p>The substitution of Latin for French had in fact
become a necessity when the determination to consult
the other Reformed Churches of the Confederation was
adopted. Native to Geneva with its French-speaking
population, French was little understood at Berne,
Basle, Z&uuml;rich, and Schaffhausen with their German inhabitants;
but the liberally educated among them were
generally familiar with Latin. Calvin, we must therefore
presume, had presented his new Articles in French,
so that they had to be translated and turned back into
Latin; but the trial appears to have suffered no particular
delay on this account. Presented anew in the
Latin tongue and approved by the Court, they were
ordered by it to be submitted to the prisoner, with the
intimation that he was required to answer them, and to
feel himself at liberty to alter or retract anything he
might now think he had written unadvisedly; to explain
anything he had said that was misunderstood;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>
and to defend such of his opinions as were challenged,
by the citation of Scripture in their support. Nor was
he to be hurried in sending in his replies; he was to
take his own time, and to enter as fully as he pleased
into every question.</p>

<p>As it is part of our business here to learn on what
grounds men of the highest culture burned one another
to death three hundred and twenty-four years ago&mdash;and
it is thought by some that there still remains such an
amount of ignorance, bigotry, and intolerance in the
world as might lead to a rekindling of the fires, were
the power to do so but added to the will&mdash;we feel bound
to make a somewhat particular study of the Articles on
which the unfortunate Servetus was finally incriminated
and doomed to die. We therefore proceed to lay
before the reader, in slightly condensed form, these
Articles, which will be seen, on the most cursory perusal,
to involve none but topics of transcendental dogmatic
theology&mdash;a subject which to reasonable men has now
lost almost all the significance it once possessed, but
which has still a large historical interest as showing, in
contrast with present views, the progress that has been
made from darkness into light; and as illustrating the
great, yet persistently neglected, truth, that the religious
feelings are no safe guides of conduct when dissevered
from the other emotional elements of human nature in
balanced action among themselves, enlightened by
science and associated with reason. Religion has in
fact at no time been the civiliser of mankind, as so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span>
commonly said, but has itself been the civilised
through advances made in science or the knowledge of
nature, and in general refinement. Brutal and blood-stained
among savages and the barbarous but policied
peoples of antiquity, Assyrians, Chald&aelig;ans, Egyptians,
Hebrews; cruel and intolerant among Newer Nations
well advanced in art and letters, but ignorant of the
world they lived in and the universe around them,
religion has only become humane as Science has been
suffered to shed her ennobling light, and will first prove
truly beneficent when Piety is seen to consist in study
of the laws of nature, which are the laws of God, and
Worship is acknowledged to be comprised in reverential
observance of their behests. What adequate idea of
God could be formed&mdash;if, indeed, it be possible for man
to form any adequate idea of God!&mdash;so long as this
earth&mdash;this mote in the ocean of Infinity&mdash;was thought
of as the centre of the universe, the one object of God’s
care, and a single family among the myriads that people
it as the sole recipients of his revealed word and will!</p>

<p>But turn we to our Articles, which we proceed to
pass under review in connection with the answers
made to them by Servetus. In these we shall now find
him more intemperate than he has yet shown himself;
more aggressive, too; not only indisposed to yield in
jot or tittle, but negligent of opportunities to defend
his conclusions, and eager to attack his pursuer; ready
to call him opprobrious names, and to charge him with
wilful misrepresentation and malignity. The recent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span>
triumph of Perrin and Berthelier had obviously infected
Servetus, and not only lost him his chance of continuing
to improve his position with his judges, but even made
him careless of making any serious effort to prove himself
in the right.</p>

<p>At the very outset of his replies, and by way of preface,
assuming the Articles to be Calvin’s and Calvin’s
alone, Servetus says: ‘It is impossible not to admire
the impudence of the man, who is nothing less than a
disciple of Simon Magus, arrogating to himself the
authority of a Doctor of the Sorbonne, condemning everything
according to his fancy, scarcely quoting Scripture
for aught he advances, and either plainly not understanding
me or artfully wresting my words from their
true significance. I am therefore compelled, before replying
to his <i>Articles</i>, to say, in brief, that the whole
purpose of my book is to show, <i>first</i>, that when the word
Son is met with in Scripture it is always to the man
Jesus that the term is applied, he having also the title
Christ given him; and, <i>second</i>, that the Son or second
Person in the Trinity is spoken of as a <i>person</i> because
there was visibly relucent in the Deity a Representation
or Image of the man Jesus Christ, hypostatically subsisting
in the Divine mind from eternity. It is because
this <i>rationale of the Person</i> is unknown to Calvin, and
because the whole thing depends thereon, that I refer
as preliminary to certain passages from the ancient
Doctors of the Church on which I rest my conclusions.’</p>

<p>Passages sixteen in number, from Tertullian,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span>
Iren&aelig;us, Clemens Romanus, and others, are then cited
to justify the sense he attaches to the words Person and
Son; from which we see that Servetus, following his
authorities, adopts the Neo-platonic view of the Son as
a pre-existing <i>idea</i> in the Divine mind, not as an <i>entity</i>
distinct from the essence of God, having a proper life
and subsistence of its own, and only proceeding in time
to become incarnate in the man Jesus.</p>

<p>We were interested, of course, in referring to these
passages from the Fathers (they are given at length
in Calvin’s Refutation); and, though disappointed in
finding them less cogent and conclusive than we had
expected, we yet discover the germs of almost all that
is more fully developed by Servetus in connection with
the subjects of which they speak. ‘Tertullian,’ says
he, ‘declares, that to conform with things human, God,
in former times, assumed human senses and affections,
and made himself visible to man in the divinity of
Christ; and that the words Person and Son of God are
used in Scripture because God, invisible, intangible in
himself, was made visible in Christ. He who spoke
with Adam in the garden, with Noah, with Abraham,
and came down to see what the Babylonians were
about, and so on, was no other than Christ or a prefiguration
of Christ. He who spoke with Moses, too,
at different times was Christ&mdash;the Relucent visible
Image or Figuration of the invisible Deity. In the
essence of God there is no real distinction between the
Father and the Son; they do not constitute two invisible
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>
entities such as the <i>Tritheiti</i> imagine; it is no
more than a <i>formal</i> distinction that is made between
the invisible Father and the visible Son. It is the
idea of prolation or procession of one thing out of
another that has given occasion to certain <i>dispositions</i>,
<i>dispensations</i>, or <i>modes</i> in the Deity being turned into
so many entities, and so into a Trinity of Persons.
Quoting St. Paul, Tertullian says that “in the face of
Christ is seen the very light of God;” and to this
I myself refer repeatedly in my Third Book on the
Trinity; but Calvin, persisting in his blindness, will
not see God thus.’</p>

<p>From Iren&aelig;us we find little that is not repetition of
what is said by Tertullian. ‘The Jews,’ he says, ‘did
not know that he who spoke with Adam and Abraham
and Moses in human form, was the Word, the Son of
God. But Jesus, as the Image, as the Word, was
then the Divine manifestation of God, being at once,
but without real distinction, both Word and Spirit; for
in the spiritual substance of the Father was comprised
the figuration and representation of the Word. Abraham
was taught and knew that the Angel who visited
him was the representative of the Word which was, or
was to be, the future man, the Son of God&mdash;dost hear,
Calvin?&mdash;the Word was the figuration of the man
Jesus! The Word is always spoken of as something
visible; so that when John says, “In the beginning
was the Word,” we are to understand the prefiguration
of Christ in the Deity: invisible in himself, God
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span>
the Father is visible in the Son. The Logos and
the Spirit imply nothing of personal distinction in God
so that, when it is said, “God made all things by
his Word,” it is himself as Creator, and not another,
that is to be understood: the Word and the
Holy Ghost are not to be thought of as distinct
entities, but as dispositions in God.’</p>

    <td>I.-IV. Servetus, says Calvin,
    maintains that all who believe
    in a Trinity in the essence
    of God are Tritheists, or have
    three Gods instead of one
    God; or they are Atheists,
    and properly have no God at
    all, their God being tripartite
    or aggregative, not absolute.
    That the three Persons of the
    Trinity are Phantoms; and
    that there should be distinct
    entities in the one God is a
    thing impossible; so that a
    Trinity of Persons in an Unity
    of Being is a dream. Further:
    That the Jews, resting on
    numerous authorities, wonder
    at the Tripartite Deity we acknowledge;
    and, yet more,
    That it was the admission of
    <i>real</i> distinctions in the
    Incorporeal

    Deity which led Mahomet

    I.-IV. From the authors
    quoted, it is evident that in the

    there is no <i>real</i> distinction

    That there is a figurative or
    personal distinction between
    the Invisible Father and the
    Visible Son, however, I admit;
    so that in this way I religiously
    believe in a Trinity,
    though denying it as usually
    understood. The truth of
    what I say about the Jews

    to be amply borne out by history

<p>But enough of this&mdash;more than enough, indeed, is
before the reader to enable him to judge of the kind of
matter that never yet influenced man in his conduct
towards either God or his fellow, on which Michael
Servetus was adjudged to die.</p>

<p>The answers of Servetus to the incriminated passages
of his book are obviously by no means either so
full or so satisfactory as he might easily have made them;
neither are they always so worded as unequivocally to
express his proper views; but of more moment than all,
they are given without the references to Scripture
which the Court had suggested, and would certainly
have had greater weight with it than aught else that
could be urged. Though he uses the words person
and hypostasis, we know that he did not understand
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span>
them in the same way as theologians generally. He
did not acknowledge any proper personality in the
nature of God, who to him was invisible, all-pervading
Essence, inscrutable too, save as manifesting and
making himself known in Creation. Servetus’s persons
and hypostases are modes or manifestations of God in
nature, and, not limited to three, are, in truth, infinite
in number, and proclaimed in an infinity of ways. To
accommodate himself in some sort to such conceptions
as were current on the subject of the Trinity, he
uses language at times which it seems might fairly
bring him within the pale of orthodoxy, were we not
aware of the arbitrary meaning he attaches to the
terms employed: God, Father, all-pervading Being;
Christ, Son, visible manifestation of God to man;
Holy Ghost, Angel&mdash;ἐνέργεια, actuating force in nature.
Such, as we understand him, was the kind of Trinity
formulated by Servetus.</p>

<p>The answers of the prisoner to the new articles of
incrimination were now ordered by the Court, which
has nothing to say to them itself, to be put into the
hands of the Reformer for his strictures. This gave
Calvin the opportunity which he did not fail to turn to
the best advantage. Treating Servetus’s Replies in a
very different spirit from that in which the Spaniard
had treated his Articles, he proceeded elaborately to
criticise and refute them; in other words, and more
properly, to demonstrate the incongruity and incompatibility
of Servetus’s admitted beliefs and opinions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span>
touching the transcendental propositions involved, with
the orthodox conclusions of himself and the Churches
generally. To a theologian like Calvin such a task
presented no difficulties; but the thoroughness of
his exposition or refutation, and the length to which
it runs, assure us of the pains he bestowed on the
work. Calvin is said to have spent no more than
two or three days in the composition of this elaborate
paper; had the time been two months and more, it
would have been little, and few men, we apprehend,
could have got through the work in less time.</p>

<p>Signed by as many as thirteen ministers beside
himself&mdash;for Calvin would not forego the backing of his
colleagues in such a cause&mdash;the Refutation of the prisoner’s
replies to his prosecutor’s Articles of Inculpation
was laid before the Court at their next meeting; and
in a spirit of entire judicial fairness, was by them
ordered to be forthwith submitted to the prisoner, for
his observations in assent to, or dissent from, the interpretations
put upon his words. He was even particularly
told, as he had been before, that he was at liberty
to answer in the way and at the length he pleased.</p>

<p>The understanding of the Court when giving
Calvin his instructions, was that his Extracts were not
to be accompanied by either note or comment&mdash;they
were to be ‘word for word’ from the writings of the
prisoner. But we see that he gave little heed to this
injunction; for many of the Articles are either prefaced
or concluded by a comment; Art. XVI. for example,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">420</span>
begins in this way: ‘That he may corrupt the saying
of the apostle,’ &amp;c.; XVII.: ‘To say that God is
Father of the Holy Ghost, is to confound the persons,’
&amp;c.; XVIII.: ‘To show that he plays with the
word person,’ &amp;c.; XXXV.: ‘After jumbling together
many insane and pernicious notions on the
substance of the soul,’ &amp;c.; XXXVIII.: ‘That he
has written and published horrible blasphemies against
the baptism of infants,’ &amp;c. Calvin, in short, could
not resist the opportunity of helping the Judges to
a conclusion in consonance with his own views, and
therefore adverse to those of his opponent.</p>

<p>When we turn to Calvin’s Refutation of the Errors
of Michael Servetus, we observe him setting out by
saying that he will not imitate the prisoner in the use
of uncivil language, but confine himself strictly to the
matters in question. He would not be John Calvin,
however, did he keep his word; and truly his language
is at times little less offensive than that of Servetus;
whilst his comments, uniformly adverse, are ever studiously
calculated to damage the prisoner in the eyes
of his Judges. ‘Whosoever,’ says Calvin in concluding
his work, ‘will duly weigh all that is here adduced,
will not fail to see that the whole purpose of Servetus
has been to extinguish the light we have in the true
doctrine, and so put an end to all religion.’ But we,
for our part, say, after some pains bestowed, that whoever
peruses the writings of Servetus without a foregone
conclusion that <i>any one among the various formulated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">421</span>
systems of religious doctrine he sees around him is
the</i> <span class="smcap">Absolute Truth</span>, <i>and alone essential to constitute
Religiousness</i>, will not fail to discover that not only
had Servetus no thought of putting out the light of
religion in the world, but that he was animated by a
most earnest desire, through another interpretation of
the Records which he, too, looked on as Revelations
from God, to set Christianity on another, and, as he
believed, a better foundation than it had yet obtained
from the labours of Luther, Calvin, and the rest of the
Reformers. Servetus was, in truth, but one among
the host of Reformers of every shade and colour who
made their appearance on the field at the trumpet-call
of Luther, and who had but this in common: hostility
to the ignorance and immorality of monk and priest,
to the pride and lust and abuse of power so conspicuous
in Pope and Roman Hierarch. And shall we in these
days think of him as impious and irreligious who held
that it was less than reasonable to speak of the coeternity
of a Father and a Son, taking the words in any
common-sense acceptation; and that a single entity
could not be conceived as subdivided into three distinct
entities or persons, without loss of its essential
unity, nor three distinct entities or persons be thought
of as amalgamated into one without loss of their several
individualities? Who said, moreover, that he believed
God to be the all-pervading essence and order of the
universe; man to be fitted for his state, each individually
answerable for his own sin, not for the sin of another,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">422</span>
and that faith in the highest exemplar of humanity
as he conceived it, that had ever appeared on earth,
added to a good life and its associate charities, was that
which was required for salvation? Shall we, we ask,
think of such a man as less pious, less religious, less
likely to be acceptable to God than one who believed
that there was a certain Word which was with God from
the beginning, and was indeed God, and yet another
than God; or that God, beside his proper all-sufficing
substance, was supplemented by several hypostases or
offsets, which were at once himself, yet other than
himself; that from eternity God had elected and
fore-ordained a relatively limited proportion of mankind
to salvation and eternal life, and doomed an infinitely
larger proportion to perdition and everlasting death?
Shall we, we say further, think that the man who was
tolerant of the speculative opinions of others, and
whose business in life it was to visit the sick and reach
the healing potion, was less of a good, and a true, and
a useful member of society, than he who aspired
through the unseen, the unknown and the unknowable,
to rule the world with a rod of iron, who was utterly
intolerant of other speculative opinions than his own,
and in enforcing his arbitrary rules for the regulation
of life and conversation, was merciless in the use of the
scourge, the branding iron, the sword, and the slow fire?
Surely we shall not. Were greatness associated in the
world with true nobility of nature, light-bringers, like
Michael Servetus, would assuredly be set on a higher
level than conquerors of kingdoms.

<h2 id="BOOK_II_CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p class="center">THE TRIAL IS CONTINUED, AND SERVETUS ADDRESSES
LETTERS TO CALVIN AND HIS JUDGES.</p>

<p>On returning to his dungeon after his examination on
September 15, Servetus addressed his prosecutor in
the following characteristic epistle, which the reply to
Art. XXI. appears to have suggested:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>To John Calvin, health!&mdash;It is for your good that I tell
you you are ignorant of the principles of things. Would you
now be better informed, I say the great principle is this: <i>All
action takes place by contact</i>. Neither Christ nor God himself
acts upon anything which he does not touch. God would not
in truth be God were there anything that escaped his contact.
All the qualities of which you dream are imaginations only,
slaves of the fields as it were. But there is no virtue of God,
no grace of God, nor anything of the sort in God which is not
God himself; neither does God put quality into aught in
which he himself is not. All is from him, by him, and in
him. When the Holy Spirit acts in us, therefore it is God
that is in us&mdash;that is in contact with us, that actuates us.</p>

<p>In the course of our discussion I detect you in another
error. To maintain the force of the old law, you quote
Christ’s words where he asks: ‘What says the law?’ and
answers himself by saying: ‘Keep the commandments.’ But
here you have to think of the law not yet accomplished, not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">424</span>
yet abrogated; to think further, that Christ, when he willed
to interpose in human things, willed to abide by the law;
and that he to whom he spoke was living under the law.
Christ, therefore, properly referred at this time to the law as
to a master. But afterwards, all things being accomplished,
the newer ages were emancipated from the older. For the
same reason it was that he ordered another to show himself
to the priest and make an offering. Shall we, therefore, do
the like? He also ordered a lamb and unleavened bread to be
prepared for the Passover: Shall we, too, make ready in this
fashion? Why do you go on Judaising in these days with
your unleavened bread? Ponder these things well, I beseech
you, and carefully read over again my twenty-third letter.
Farewell.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a></p></blockquote>

<p>How little likely this epistle, however reasonable in
itself, was calculated to win the favour of Calvin, need
not be said. To pretend to set John Calvin right in
anything could, indeed, only be taken by him as an
impertinence.</p>

<p>In the present disposition towards the prisoner&mdash;the
purely metaphysical and undemonstrable nature of
the matters in debate, taken into account&mdash;we may
reasonably conclude that the Judges had hoped he
would be able to explain away the offensive and heretical
sense in which his views were regarded by the
head of their Church&mdash;and indeed, and in so far as
they could be understood, as they must have been seen
by themselves.</p>

<p>But Servetus, unhappily for himself, did not improve
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">425</span>
the opportunity presented him of righting himself in
any way with the Court by the manner in which he
set about dealing with Calvin’s strictures on his replies
to the incriminated passages of his book. He does not
now, as he had done before, however curtly and imperfectly,
reply to the Reformer’s refutations, and show
wherein he is misinterpreted or misunderstood; neither
does he present his views in another and more questionable
light than they are set by his accuser, which
he could readily have done in numerous instances at
least; and, where this was impossible, he might have
appealed to the reason and common sense of his Judges
for latitude in interpreting matters that really lie
beyond the scope of the human understanding. He,
however, did nothing of all this, but proceeded as
though he thought it neither necessary nor worth his
while to defend himself or his opinions any further&mdash;he
did not even take paper of his own for his reply, but
contented himself with jottings on the margins and between
the lines of Calvin’s elaborate refutation! the remarks
he makes, moreover, being rarely in the way of
answer or explanation. They are mostly curt expressions
of dissent, or simply abusive epithets applied to
the Reformer, who is called Simon Magus, liar, calumniator,
persecutor, homicide, and more besides. Instead
of persisting in his legitimate plea that he was but
another in the ranks of the Reformers, interpreting the
Scriptures by the understanding he had by nature and
his education, or declaring, as he had done before,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">426</span>
that he would be found ready to abjure those of his
opinions that were shown him to be opposed to their
teaching, and adverse to the peace of the world, he threw
down the gauntlet on the whole question, not to Calvin
only, but to the religious world at large. But this, the
point of view from which the religious question was regarded
in the middle of the sixteenth century, considered,
was simply to ensure his condemnation. Men
less bigoted, and, above all, less under the influence of
the most intolerant of bigots, might possibly have been
led to take pity on the writer, and to see him for what
he was in truth&mdash;a sincerely pious zealot of irreproachable
life, if much mistaken, as they believed, in his theological
conclusions; and so, and save in the use of intemperate
language, excusable on every ground of
Christian charity. But this, perhaps, was more than
could possibly be expected in the fifteen-hundred-and-fifty-third
year of the Christian &aelig;ra.</p>

<p>In returning the document so unhappily annotated,
Servetus appears to have felt that an apology was due
to the Court for the style of response he had adopted.
He therefore accompanied it with the following letter,
in which he seeks to excuse himself for the course he
has taken:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>My Lords,&mdash;I have been induced to write on Calvin’s paper
as there are so many short, interrupted expressions which,
apart from the context, would have neither sense nor signification.
But doing as I have done, setting the <i>pros</i> and <i>cons</i>
in juxtaposition, Messieurs the Judges will be able more
readily to decide on the questions in debate. Calvin must
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">427</span>
not be offended with me for this, for I have not touched a
word of his writing; and it was not possible, without infinite
confusion, to do otherwise than as I have done. Be pleased,
my Lords, to let those who may be appointed to judge or
report, have the two books now sent, as they will be thereby
spared the trouble of searching out the passages referred to,
these being all duly indicated. If Calvin makes any remarks
on what is now said, may it please you to communicate them
to me.</p>

Your poor prisoner,<br />
<span class="smcap">Michael Servetus</span>.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>This epistle, like the petitions presented to them,
received no notice from the Council, which at this time
was seriously engaged with business more interesting
to them in their civil and administrative spheres; so
that for some fourteen days no heed was given to the unfortunate
Servetus rotting in the felon’s gaol of Geneva,
or to the preparation and despatch of the documents to
be submitted to the Councils and Churches of the four
Protestant Cantons.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">428</span></p>

<h2 id="BOOK_II_CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<p class="center">CALVIN ANTICIPATES THE JUDGES IN THEIR APPEAL TO
THE SWISS CHURCHES.</p>

<p>Calvin, unlike Servetus, was never remiss. Sedulous
to leave as little as might be to accident, and nothing, if
he could guard against it, to independent conclusion,
he did not fail to take advantage of the pause in the
proceedings that now occurred, by being beforehand
with the judges, and writing to the leading ministers
of the Swiss Churches, every one of whom was of
course personally known, and, with few exceptions,
even servilely devoted, to him. Addressing Henry
Bullinger, on September 7, he says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Council will send you, ere long, the opinions of
Servetus in order to have your advice. It is in spite of us
that you have this trouble forced on you; but the folks here
have come to such a pass of folly and fury that they are suspicious
of all we say. Did I declare that there was daylight
at noon, I believe they would question it. Brother Walter
[Bullinger’s son-in-law] will tell you more [of the state of
affairs here].</p></blockquote>

<p>Calvin, it would therefore appear, did not like the
appeal to the Churches. We have said that he had
formerly been baffled in his pursuit of Jerome Bolsec,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">429</span>
by the moderation they recommended when consulted on
the case. He would have had his own and the Church
of Geneva’s decision suffice; the motion for appeal
to the wider sphere, moreover, seems really to have
come from Servetus, and this of itself would have
sufficed to make it distasteful to Calvin. The Council’s
giving in to it must have been regarded by him, if not
as an insult, yet as a mark of distrust: hence his
angry allusion to the fury and folly of the Genevese.
He made the best of the matter, however, as we have
said, by having the start of the Council; and not only
writing to the chiefs of the four Churches, but in the
case of Z&uuml;rich at least, by sending a messenger&mdash;Brother
Walter&mdash;specially commissioned to give Bullinger,
its head pastor, information of a kind he would
not trust to writing.</p>

<p>Bullinger, in reply to the written and verbal communication,
informs Calvin that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘Walter’s news has indeed saddened and disquieted him
greatly.’ In some sort of trouble himself, as it seems, Bullinger
can heartily sympathise with his brother of Geneva; yet is
he ‘without fear for the future, though there be in the town
around him more dogs and swine than he could desire! Still
many things are to be put up with for the sake of the Elect,
and we have to enter the Kingdom of Heaven through great
tribulation. But do not, I beseech you, forsake a Church
which has so many excellent men within its pale. Bear all
for the sake of the Elect. Think what cause of rejoicing your
retreat would give to the enemies of the Reformation, and
with what danger it would be fraught to the French refugees.
Remain! The Lord will not forsake you. He has, indeed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">430</span>
now presented the noble Council of Geneva with a most
favourable opportunity of clearing itself from the foul stain of
heresy, by delivering into its hands the Spaniard Servetus.
You will have heard, of course, that he has put forth another
book, wherein he surpasses himself in impiety; but if the
blasphemous scoundrel be dealt with as he deserves, the
whole world will own that the Genevese have the impious in
horror, that they are forward to pursue the obstinate heretic
with the sword of justice, and well disposed to assert the
glory of the Divine Majesty! Nevertheless, and in any case
should they not do so, you ought not to abandon your post
and expose the Church to new misfortunes. Fight on bravely,
then, trusting in God.’<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></p></blockquote>

<p>From what he says, we see that Bullinger had not
been informed of all that had taken place in Geneva,
and that the printing of ‘the other book,’ which he
could not yet have seen, had been the occasion of its
author’s arrest and trial. But the letter to Calvin,
prompted by the news he had received through Brother
Walter, satisfies us that Calvin at this time felt little
at his ease in Geneva, and in nowise sure of the
support he was to have from his friend Bullinger.
He had no doubts as to the theological criminality
of Servetus; neither had he any qualms as to the
kind of punishment he designed for him; but he was
wroth with the Council for the impartiality it showed
towards one who had dared, as he believed, to beard
him in his own domain, and ventured to subscribe
himself as having the support of the great heavenly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">431</span>
head of all the Churches. As Calvin interpreted the
latest proceedings of the Council, they appeared
simply hostile to himself. Failing now in his prosecution
of the Spaniard, his social influence would be compromised,
and with the check he had just received in the
affair of Berthelier, and the power of the Consistory
to excommunicate, whereby his religious foothold was
seriously shaken, he must have threatened, if he did not
really contemplate, the extreme step of abandoning the
Genevese to their own evil devices. Bullinger probably
took Calvin’s threat of quitting his charge in Geneva,
as conveyed to him by Brother Walter, too literally.
From the suspicion of any such purpose, we find him
anxious immediately to clear himself by the letter he
forthwith addressed to the Z&uuml;rich pastor:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘From your letter, most excellent Brother (he says), I learn
that you have not been so accurately informed of the griefs
whereof I complain as I could have wished. The wicked
people about me, knowing that I am irritable, my stomach
troubling me often and in various ways, have lately been
striving to get the better of my patience. But sharp as the
struggle has been, they have not succeeded in turning me in
the slightest measure from my course. I have been armed
against all the arrows they have aimed at me. The Lord
may have put me of late so sorely to the proof among this
people, that I might learn by experience what heavy trials
have to be borne by his ministers. He who has upheld me
hitherto will not, I trust, fail to possess me with less fortitude
in time to come. Wherefore, trusting in his aid, I have
never been really minded to quit the station in which he has
placed me. Never once, when your Walter was here lately,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">432</span>
did I think of giving way and yielding to the contumelies
and indignities that were heaped upon me. The report to
the contrary was raised by the factious, that they might injure
me.’</p>

<p>Calvin then goes on to inform his friend of the affair of
Berthelier, and the permission he had received from the
Council to present himself at the Lord’s Supper, and continues:
‘Knowing the brazen face of the man who, with every occasion
given him, has still stood in my way; and believing
that he would be disposed to vanquish me if he could, I declared
to the Council that I would not administer to him, and
said that I would sooner die than prostitute the bread of the
Lord by giving it to dogs or such as made a mockery of the
Gospel, and trod the ordinances of the Church under foot.
You have not understood aright what I said. Do not imagine
that anything is changed. Something more may possibly be
attempted at the next meeting of the Council. May the Lord
lead the perverse to desist from their efforts! For my part,
it is certain that I will never suffer the discipline sanctioned
by the senate, and the decree of the people, to be set aside.
If I am prevented from discharging the duties of my office,
I may have to yield to force, but I will never renounce the
liberty I possess; for, that abandoned, my ministry would be
in vain. I am not made of such stubborn stuff, however, as
not to feel sorely distressed when I think of the future scattering
of this flock; but whilst I have the power, I shall do all
I can to hold them in the right way. Do you with your
prayers come to our aid, and entreat that Christ may keep to
himself his flock of this place.</p>

<p>Things go on no better in France. Wherever there is the
pretext, they do not spare bloodshed. Three are condemned
to death at Dijon, if they be not already burned; and the
danger is that the commotions we hear of in Scotland will
add fuel to the fires. Seven or eight youthful persons have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">433</span>
been thrown into prison at Nemours, and in several other
French towns many more have met with a like fate. Farewell!</p></blockquote>

<p>The letter which Calvin wrote about the same
time to Sulzer, pastor of Basle, also deserves a place
here, as showing the pains he took to influence the
minds of his friends in his own favour and against
Servetus.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The name of Servetus, who, twenty years ago, infected
the Christian world with his vile and pestilent doctrines, is
not, I presume, unknown to you. Even if you have not read
his book, it is scarcely possible that you should not have heard
something of the kind of opinions he holds. He it is of whom
Bucer, of blessed memory, that faithful minister of Christ, a
man otherwise of the most gentle nature, declared that ‘he
deserved to be disembowelled and torn in pieces.’ As in
days gone by, so of late he has not ceased from spreading
abroad his poison; for he has just had a larger volume secretly
printed at Vienne, crammed full of the same errors. The
printing of the book having been divulged, however, he was
thrown into prison there. Escaping from prison&mdash;by what
means I know not&mdash;he wandered about in Italy for some
four months; but driven hither at length by his evil destiny&mdash;<i>tandem
hic malis auspiciis appulsum</i>&mdash;one of the syndics, at
my instigation, had him arrested.</p>

<p>Nor do I deny that I have been led by my office to do all
in my power to restrain this more than obstinate and indomitable
individual, so that the contagion should continue no
longer. We see with what licence impiety stalks abroad,
scattering ever new errors; and we have also to note the
indifference of those whom God has armed with the sword to
vindicate the glory of his name. If the Papists approve
themselves so zealous and so much in earnest for their superstitions,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">434</span>
that they cruelly persecute and shed the blood of
innocent persons, is it not disgraceful in Christian magistrates
to show so little heart in defending the assured Truth? But
where there is the power of prevention, there are surely limits
to the moderation that suffers blasphemy to be vented with
impunity.</p>

<p>As regards this man, then, there are three things to be
considered: First, the monstrous errors with which he corrupts
all religion, the detestable heresies with which he strives
to overthrow all piety, and the abominable fancies with which
he surrounds Christianity, and seeks to upset from the
foundation every principle of our Faith. Secondly, the obstinacy
with which he has comported himself, the diabolical
persistency with which he has despised all the counsels given
him, and the desperate insistance wherewith he has been forward
to spread his poison. Thirdly, the daring with which
he, even now, produces his abominations. So far is he from
showing any sign or giving any hope of amendment, that he
does not scruple to fasten his plague-spot on those holy men,
Capito and Œcolampadius&mdash;as if they were his associates!
Shown the letters of Œcolampadius, he said he wondered by
what spirit he, Œcolampadius, had been induced to depart
from his first opinion!...</p>

<p>There is but one thing more on which I would have you
advised, viz.: That the Questor of our city, who will deliver
you this, is of a right mind in the business, which is, that the
prisoner shall not escape the fate we desire&mdash;<i>ut saltem exitum
quem optamus non fugiat</i>.</p>

<p>I say nothing now of French affairs; there being no news
here of which I imagine you are not as well informed as we,
unless it be that on last Sabbath-day three of our pious
brothers were burned to death at Lyons, and a fourth met a
like fate in a neighbouring town. It is scarcely credible how
these men, illiterate, but enlightened by the spirit of God, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">435</span>
ennobled by the perfections of the Doctrine, behaved on the
occasion; with what unswerving constancy they met their
fate. But it is not there only; in other parts of France burnings
of the same sort go on incessantly; nor seems there any
prospect of mitigation. Farewell!</p>

<p>Geneva; v. of the Ides (19) of Septr. 1553.</p></blockquote>

<p>Calvin, we see from this epistle, believed that he
would be fully justified in having Michael Servetus
burned alive at Geneva because they differed in their
interpretation of the Trinity; but that the Papists of
Lyons were inexcusable for sending to a fiery death
those who with himself did not acknowledge the Pope
as God’s vicegerent on earth, and Romish doctrine
as the true and only saving faith. It is the <i>evil destiny</i>
of Servetus, too, that has led him into the toils of the
Reformer; and to be of a <i>right mind</i> in the business
of the prosecution, then proceeding is, so to play into
the hands of the prosecutor that his victim shall not
escape the death designed him!</p>

<p>It was of Z&uuml;rich, however, more than of any of the
Churches consulted, that Calvin felt most in doubt.
The tolerant views of Zwingli were in some sort hereditary
there; and Bullinger, who was its chief pastor,
had disappointed him in the case of Bolsec. But he
must also have had strong misgivings of Basle, when
he was induced to write the long and particular letter
to Sulzer, its leading minister, which we have just
perused. The more refined and delicate tone that is
said to have pervaded society in the city of Basle indisposed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">436</span>
its people to violence or extremes; and
‘Thorough’ was always the word on Calvin’s banner.</p>

<p>If he had doubts of Z&uuml;rich and Basle, Calvin could
place implicit reliance on Neuchatel, where Farel, his
oldest, most devoted, and most obsequious friend presided
as head of the Church. Addressing Farel soon
after the arrest of Servetus, he writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is even as you say, my dear Farel,&mdash;we are indeed
variously and sorely tried and tossed about by storms! We
have now a <i>new</i> business with Servetus&mdash;<i>jam novum habemus
cum Serveto negotium</i>. His intention may, perchance, have
been to pass through this city; but it is not precisely known
why he came hither. When he was recognised, however, I
thought it right to have him arrested, my man Nicholas presenting
himself as accuser on the capital charge, and binding
himself by the law of retaliation, to proceed against him.
Articles of accusation under as many as forty heads were
presented in writing on the day following the arrest. He
prevaricated at first, which led to our being called in. Recognising
me, he behaved as though he held me obnoxious to
him. I, as became me, gave no heed to him. The senate, in
fine, approved of all the charges, and he was sent back to
prison. On the third day after, my brother becoming bail
for Nicholas, he was set at liberty.</p>

<p>I say nothing of the effrontery of the man; but such was
his madness that [in the course of the interrogatory] he did
not hesitate to say the Devil was in the Deity&mdash;<i>Diabolus inesse
Divinitatem</i>&mdash;and more, that in so many men there were so
many gods, Deity being substantially communicated to them,
as, indeed, he said it was to stocks and stones! <i>I hope the
sentence will be capital at the least&mdash;Spero capitale saltem fore
judicium</i>; but I would have the cruel manner of carrying it
out remitted. Farewell!</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">437</span></p>

<p>Calvin’s charge was therefore, as we see, to no
halting or half-way conclusion. He proceeded from the
first for a capital conviction&mdash;he hoped it would be
nothing short of this; and being so, he knew the kind
of death the man must die. It is a poor show of
humanity, therefore, that he makes at the end of his
letter. But there is a phrase at the beginning of the
epistle which deserves very particular notice: ‘<i>Iam
novum habemus cum Serveto negotium</i>&mdash;we have now
on hand a <i>new business</i> with Servetus.’ But there was
no <i>older business</i> with Servetus at Geneva. It was at
Vienne that this took place. Writing to Farel, his
oldest and most trusted friend, Calvin reverts in mind
to the fact, and his words reflect or echo back his
inward thought. Of the justice of this surmise we
seem to find confirmation in Viret’s letter of August 22,
which we have seen in reply to the one in which Calvin
inquires after a copy of the book on Trinitarian Error;
for there the pastor of Lausanne says: <i>Nunc vobis est
alia cum Serveto disputatio</i>&mdash;and now you have <i>another</i>
contention with Servetus;<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> an obvious reference to
a passage in one of the Reformer’s letters of the same
tenor as that he has just addressed to Farel. Calvin,
it is notorious, always shirked acknowledgment of
the part he played in the affair of Vienne. Even
the self-complacency that comes of theological zeal
did not permit him to find an excuse for underhand
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">438</span>
dealing, and the violation of a correspondence that was
private and entirely confidential. He was, by no means,
insensible to the infamy that cleaves to an act of the
kind, however, and in his own case could say, ‘Zebed&aelig;us
has been perfidiously showing confidential letters
of mine, which I wrote to him fifteen years ago from
Strasburg!’<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a></p>

<p>Farel’s reply to the last epistle of Calvin, dated
from Neufchatel on September 8, is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I have returned from Normandy, restored to my usual
good state of health.... It is a wonderful dispensation of
God that has brought Servetus to this country. I wish he
may come to his senses, late though it be. It will indeed be
a miracle if he prefer death, and, turning to God, consent to
edify the spectators&mdash;he dying one death who has caused the
death of so many others!</p>

<p>Your judges will only show themselves hard-hearted contemners
of Christ, enemies of the true Church and of its pious
doctrine, if they prove insensible to the horrible blasphemies
of so wicked a heretic. But I hope God will so order it that
they may merit commendation by putting out of the way the
man who has so long and so obstinately persevered in his
heresies to the perdition of so many! In desiring to have
the cruelty of the punishment mitigated, you appear as the
friend of him who has been your greatest enemy. There
are some, however, who would let heretics be doing&mdash;as
if there were any difference between the office of the
pastor and that of the magistrate! Because the Pope condemns
the faithful for the crime of heresy, and hostile judges
cause innocent persons to undergo the punishment that should
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">439</span>
be reserved for blasphemers, it is absurd to conclude that
heretics are not to be put to death, in order that the faithful
may be preserved. But do you act, I pray, in such a manner
as to show that in time to come no one will be suffered to
promulgate new doctrines and to throw everything into confusion,
as this Servetus has done. For my own part, I have
often said that I should be ready to suffer death did I teach
aught that was opposed to the true doctrine, and should
deem myself deserving of the most terrible tortures did I turn
even one from the faith that is in Christ. I would not, therefore,
apply to another a different rule.</p></blockquote>

<p>Farel is neither an elegant nor an agreeable, still
less a logical, writer; but he is zealous in behalf of the
true doctrine&mdash;the doctrine, to wit, he holds himself.
God, the father of mankind, who sends the rain and
the sunshine indifferently on all, has, in the opinion
of this poor bigot, by a special dispensation of his
providence, led a sincerely pious man, according to
his lights, to Geneva, there to be first harshly and
ignominiously treated by another sincerely pious man,
according to his lights; and finally through the influence
he exerts over its clergy and magistracy, to be
put to a lingering death by slow fire! Farel never
thought of himself, with his ‘True Doctrine,’ as a
heretic in the highest degree in the eyes of his neighbours
the Roman Catholics of France with <i>their</i> ‘True
Doctrine.’</p>

<p>It is more than questionable, indeed, whether Farel
had ever read a word of Servetus’s writings. He was
a man of action, fearless, full of fiery zeal, and a ready
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">440</span>
talker, but with no great amount of scholarly acquirement,
and still less of philosophy. In anything of his
we have seen, and save in what is said of his harangues,
he never meets us otherwise than as a man of narrow
mind, utterly intolerant and entirely under the influence
of Calvin. If Servetus had sinned by persevering in
heresy, and corrupting souls, so had he, so had Calvin,
so had Melanchthon and the rest, in the estimation of
their neighbours the Papists of neighbouring lands; and,
though he speaks glibly of myriads who had lost their
chance of salvation through Servetus, there was never
a tittle of evidence adduced on the trial to show that
even a single individual had been influenced by his
writings. On the contrary, all who are brought forward
in connection whether with the man or his works&mdash;Œcolampadius,
Bucer, Melanchthon&mdash;are proof and
more than proof against both him and them. Calvin
and Farel, as we see, had made up their minds that
Servetus was to be condemned to death weeks before
the conclusion of his trial.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">441</span></p>

<h2 id="BOOK_II_CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p class="center">SERVETUS SENDS A LETTER AND A SECOND REMONSTRANCE
AND PETITION TO HIS JUDGES.</p>

<p>Smarting under a sense of the unjustifiable treatment
to which he was so relentlessly subjected, and weary
of the delays that had taken place through the disputes
between the Consistory represented by Calvin, and the
Council, Servetus now gave vent to the pent-up storm
within him in the following characteristic remonstrance.
Alluding to the backing his persecutor received from
the clergy, and the number of names attached to the
Refutation of his Replies, he exclaims:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Thus far we have had clamour enough and a great crowd
of subscribers! But what places in Scripture do they adduce
as their authority for the Invisible Individual Son they acknowledge?
They refer to none; nor, indeed, will they ever
be able to point to any. Is this becoming in these great
ministers of the Divine Word, who everywhere boast that they
teach nothing that is not confirmed by distinct passages of
Holy Writ? But no such places are now forthcoming; and my
doctrine, consequently, is impugned by mere clamour, without
a shadow of reason, and without the citation of a single
authority against it.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="smcap">Michael Servetus</span>,<br />
who signs alone, but has Christ for his sure protector!</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">442</span></p>

<p>Engaged with more immediate and interesting
business in the political and administrative sphere of
their duties, the Council had, in fact, left that in which
their prisoner Michael Servetus was so particularly
concerned unnoticed for something like fourteen days.
This long delay gave him reasonable cause for complaint,
and furnished him with grounds not only for the
outburst given above, but for a further petition and remonstrance
to the following effect:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center"><i>To the Syndics and Council of Geneva.</i></p>

<p>My most honoured Lords!&mdash;I humbly entreat of you to
put an end to these great delays, or to exonerate me of the
criminal charge. You must see that Calvin is at his wit’s end
and knows not what more to say, but for his pleasure would
have me rot here in prison. The lice eat me up alive; my
breeches are in rags, and I have no change&mdash;no doublet, and
but a single shirt in tatters.</p>

<p>I made another request to you, which was for God’s sake;
but to prevent your granting it, Calvin alleged Justinian
against me. It is surely unfortunate for him that he brings
against me that which he does not himself believe. He neither
believes nor does he agree with what Justinian says of the
Church, of Bishops, of the Clergy, nor of many things besides
connected with religion. He knows well enough that [in
Justinian’s day] the Church was already corrupted. This is
disgraceful in him&mdash;all the more disgraceful as he keeps me
here for the last five weeks in close confinement, and has not
yet adduced a single passage [of Scripture] against me.</p>

<p>I have also demanded to have counsel assigned me. This
would have been granted me in my native country; and here
I am a stranger and ignorant of the laws and customs of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">443</span>
land. Yet you have given counsel to my accuser, whilst
refusing it to me, and have further set him at large before
having taken any true cognisance of my cause. I now demand
that my cause may be referred to the Council of Two
Hundred. If I am permitted to appeal to it, I hereby appeal;
declaring, as I do, that I will take on me all the expenses,
damages, and interests, and abide by the award of the Lex
Talionis as well in respect of my first accuser [De la Fontaine]
as of Calvin his master, who has now taken the prosecution
into his own hands.</p>

<p>From your prison of Geneva, this 15th of Septr. 1553.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="smcap">Michael Servetus</span>,<br />
in his own cause.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Council appear to have been nowise moved
by this very reasonable petition. The request for
counsel, here reiterated, was not noticed&mdash;it had already
been disposed of, and could not be granted; but
the petition to have his case referred to the Council of
the Two Hundred was discussed and rejected: the
tribunal before which he was on his trial was competent
in every respect by the laws of the State. Orders, however,
were given that the articles of clothing he required
should be procured for him at his proper cost; but as
it seems to have been the business of no one to see the
order carried into effect, or because the Council and
custodians of the gaol of Geneva were accustomed to
see their prisoners in rags and devoured by vermin, it
was unheeded at the time, although attended to at a
somewhat later period in this eventful history.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">444</span></p>

<p>Had there been no resolution to take the opinion
of the Councils and Churches of the confederate Reformed
Cantons, everything necessary to a decision
was again before the Court. The term had indeed
been exceeded within which by the law of Geneva the
proceedings ought to have ended&mdash;the law positively
forbidding the protraction of a criminal suit beyond the
term of a calendar month. The law had, therefore, been
violated; but there was no one to urge the point in
behalf of the prisoner, any more than there had been to
expose Calvin’s disobedience of the Council’s orders to
present his Articles of Incrimination without note or
comment. Neither the Clerical nor the Libertine party,
however, had yet done with the unfortunate Servetus,
although it was not before their meeting of September
21 that the Council found itself at leisure to take up
the tangled skein of the Servetus-prosecution again,
and to order the necessary documents to be prepared
for submission to the Councils and Churches they had
determined to consult. Before despatching these when
ready, they seem to have thought it would be well to
show Calvin the short demurrers of Servetus to his
elaborate Refutation; expecting, probably, that he would
have something to say to them, but not meaning to let
Servetus see anything Calvin might think proper to
add. There was no occasion however, as it fell out,
to act on this rather partial reservation. The Reformer
did not think fit to notice even one of the unhappy
annotations of his enemy, in which the lie direct is given
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">445</span>
him something like fifty times; and the epithet <i>nebulo</i>&mdash;knave&mdash;is
not the most offensive that is applied to him.
He did not add a word to what he had already written.
A mere glance at the unhappy jottings sufficed, as it
seemed, to make him feel sure of his suit; Servetus,
he saw, stood self-condemned in his neglect to adduce
Scripture authority for his peculiar views, or to show
that they had either been misinterpreted or misunderstood
by his pursuer. The abusive epithets so plentifully
heaped on Calvin only recoiled upon himself.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">446</span></p>

<h2 id="BOOK_II_CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<p class="center">THE SWISS COUNCILS AND CHURCHES ARE ADDRESSED
BY THE COUNCIL OF GENEVA.</p>

<p>From the duel as heretofore carried on between Calvin,
backed by the Ministers of Geneva, and Servetus,
seconded by Christ alone, as he said, the process was
now to be widened in its scope and debated between
the solitary stranger and the Reformation at large, or
so much of it at least as was represented by the Protestant
Churches of Berne, Basle, Z&uuml;rich, and Schaffhausen.
As many as four copies of the writings that
had passed between the prosecution and the prisoner
had, therefore, to be made, and for this a couple of days
were required; so that it was not until after the third
week of September that the messenger usually charged
by the authorities of Geneva with their despatches was
furnished with his credentials to the Councils and
Ministers of the four towns named. The documents
forwarded were copies of the ‘Christianismi Restitutio,’
and of the works of Tertullian and Iren&aelig;us; the thirty-eight
articles from the writings of Servetus extracted
by Calvin; Servetus’s replies to these in defence of his
views; and Calvin’s Refutation of his errors, as he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">447</span>
characterised them, having Servetus’s jottings, disclaimers,
and abusive epithets interspersed. Grounding
their opinions on these lengthy documents, the Swiss
Churches were requested to declare themselves on the
orthodox or heretical nature of the passages inculpated,
and so, in fact, to pronounce on the guilt or innocence
of the prisoner in respect of the heresy and blasphemy
imputed to him; their standard being, of course, the
particular form of Christianity professed by the prosecutor
and themselves.</p>

<p>In referring to the Churches in communion with
that of Geneva, the Council is careful to say that it
would not be supposed to entertain any doubts of the
competency of the Church of Geneva to pronounce a
definitive opinion on the questions at issue; it would
only have further light before coming to a decision in
a matter of so much moment. The style of address
adopted by the Council of Geneva to the Councils and
Churches of the Cantons consulted will be sufficiently
appreciated from the letters sent to Z&uuml;rich. And first
the one addressed to the Ministers:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="author">Geneva, September 21, 1553.</p>

<p>Honourable Sirs!&mdash;Well assured that you are every way
disposed to persevere in the good and holy purpose of upholding
and furthering the Word of God, we have thought we
should do you an injustice did we not inform you of the business
in which we have been engaged for some time past. It
is this. There is a man now in prison with us, Michael Servetus
by name, who has thought fit to write and have printed
certain books on the Holy Scriptures, containing matters which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">448</span>
we think are nowise according to God and the holy evangelical
doctrine. He has been heard [in his defence] by our
ministers, who have drawn up Articles against him, to which
he has replied, and to his replies answers have been given&mdash;all
in writing; and we pray you, for the honour of God, to
take the papers now forwarded to you into consideration, and
to return them by the same messenger with your opinion and
advice. We beg you further to look into the book which will
be delivered to you by our messenger, so that you may be
well and fully informed of the unhappy propositions of the
writer.</p>

<p>In writing thus and asking your advice we desire to say
that we do so without any mistrust of our own ministers.</p>

<p class="center"><i>To the Burgomaster and Council of Z&uuml;rich.</i></p>

<p class="author">
Geneva, September 22, 1553.</p>

<p>High and mighty Lords!&mdash;We know not if your Lordships
are aware that we have in hand a prisoner, Michael Servetus
by name, who has written and had printed a book containing
many things against our religion. This we have shown to
our ministers; and, although we have no mistrust of them, we
desire to communicate the work to you, in order that, if it so
please you, you may lay it before your clergy, together with
the replies and rejoinders that have been made in connection
therewith. We therefore pray you to be good enough to
submit the documents now sent to your ministers and request
them to give us their opinion of their merits, to the end that
we may bring the business, to which they refer, to a close.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the result of the course now taken the fate of
Servetus evidently depended. Did the four Swiss
Churches find the extracts from his writings heretical
and blasphemous, the Council of Geneva, in their capacity
of criminal judges, would find themselves justified
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">449</span>
in passing upon him the extreme sentence of the
law; and Calvin’s determined pursuit not only of his
theological opponent and personal enemy, but of his
political antagonist and, in some sort, <i>rival</i>, as he had
been made to appear through the espousal of his cause
by the leaders of the Libertine party, would be brought
to the conclusion he desired.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">450</span></p>

<h2 id="BOOK_II_CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<p class="center">SERVETUS AGAIN ADDRESSES THE SYNDICS AND
COUNCIL OF GENEVA, AND ACCUSES CALVIN.</p>

<p>If Calvin, then, as we apprehend, had every reason to
anticipate an answer in his favour from the Churches,
so do we find Servetus possessed by the assured hope
that he would be acquitted, or, at most, be found guilty
of nothing involving a heavier penalty than banishment
from the Republic of Geneva. Of heresy he did not
think for a moment he had been more guilty than every
one of the Reformers whom he had been accustomed to
hear spoken of in the polite circles of Vienne not only
as schismatics, but as heretics of the deepest dye. If
his ‘Restoration of Christianity’ had been burned by
the hangman of Vienne, had not Calvin’s ‘Institutions
of the Christian Religion’ been summarily condemned
by the whole Catholic world, and put on the
Index of prohibited books by the Roman Curia?
So sure does Servetus appear to have felt of final
acquittal at this time&mdash;guiltless of blasphemy as in
his soul he knew himself to be, and bolstered by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">451</span>
false hopes of his false friends, that whilst the scales
of justice were still trembling on the beam, he, from
his filthy cell, in rags, and devoured by vermin, even
he aspired to become the accuser of the man by
whom he was himself accused, and subjected to all
the indignities he endured! It could only have
been under the excitement of some such persuasion
that he now wrote the following extraordinary letter
to the Council:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center"><i>To the Syndics and Council of Geneva.</i></p>

<p>My most honoured Lords,&mdash;I am detained on a criminal
charge at the instance of John Calvin, who has accused me,
falsely saying that in my writings I maintain&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. That the soul of man is mortal, and</p>

<p>2nd. That Jesus Christ had only taken the fourth part of
his body from the Virgin Mary.</p>

<p>These are horrible, execrable charges. Of all heresies and
crimes, I think of none greater than that which would make
the soul of man to be mortal. In every other there is hope of
salvation, but none in this. He who should say what I am
charged with saying, neither believes in God nor justice, in the
resurrection, in Christ Jesus, in the Scriptures, nor, indeed, in
anything, but declares that all is death, and that man and
beast are alike. Had I said anything of the kind&mdash;said it not
in words only, but written and published it, I should myself
think me worthy of death.</p>

<p>Wherefore, my Lords, I demand that my false accuser be
declared subject to the law of retaliation, and like me be sent
to prison until the cause between him and me, for death or
other penalty, is decided. To this effect I here engage
myself against him, submit myself to all that the Lex Talionis
requires, and declare that I shall be content to die if I am
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">452</span>
not borne out in everything I shall bring against him. My
Lords, I demand of you, justice, justice, justice!</p>

<p>From your prison of Geneva, this 22nd of September,

<span class="smcap">Michael Servetus</span>,<br />
pleading his own cause.</p></blockquote>

<p>The letter was followed by a series of articles in form
like those lately brought against himself, headed&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center"><i>Articles on which Michael Servetus demands that John Calvin<br />
be interrogated.</i></p>

<p>I. Whether in the month of March last he did not write,
by the hand of William Trie, to Lyons, and say many things
about Michael Villanovanus called Servetus. What were the
contents of the letter, and with what motive was it sent?</p>

<p>II. Whether with the letter in question he sent half of the
first sheet of the book of the said Michael Servetus, entitled
‘Christianismi Restitutio,’ on which were the Title, the Table
of Contents, and the beginning of the work?</p>

<p>III. Whether this was not sent with a view to its being
shown to the authorities of Lyons, in order to have Servetus
arrested and impeached, as happened in fact?</p>

<p>IV. Whether he has not heard since then that in consequence
of the charges thereby brought against him, he, the
said Servetus, had been burned in effigy, and his property
confiscated; he himself having only escaped burning in
person by escaping from prison?</p>

<p>V. Whether he does not know that it is no business of a
minister of the gospel to appear as a criminal accuser and
pursuer of a man judicially on a capital charge?</p>

<p>My Lords, there are four great and notable reasons why
Calvin ought to be condemned:</p>

<p><i>First</i>: Because doctrinal matters are no subjects for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">453</span>
criminal prosecutions, as I have shown in my petition, and
will show more fully from the Doctors of the Church. Acting
as he has done, he has therefore gone beyond the province of
a minister of the Gospel, and gravely sinned against justice.</p>

<p><i>Second</i>: Because he is a false accuser, as the above
articles declare, and as is easily proved by reading my book.</p>

<p><i>Third</i>: Because by frivolous reasons and calumnious
assertions he would suppress the Truth as it is in Jesus
Christ, as will be made obvious to you, by reference to my
writings; what he has said of me, being full of lies and
wickedness.</p>

<p><i>Fourth</i>: Because he follows the doctrine of Simon Magus,
in great part, against all the Doctors of the Church. Wherefore,
magician as he is, he deserves not only to be condemned,
but to be banished and cast out of your city, his goods
being adjudged to me in recompense for mine which he has
made me to lose. These, my Lords, are the demands I
make.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="smcap">Michael Servetus</span>,<br />
in his own cause.</p></blockquote>

<p>Although we have only conjecture to aid us in
understanding the temper that now shows itself in
Servetus, and the hope he evidently entertains of
triumphing over his prosecutor, we cannot be mistaken
in ascribing it to the influence of Perrin and Berthelier.
They must have imagined that the same result would
ensue from the appeal to the Churches as had followed
the reference made to them in the case of Jerome Bolsec,
and believed that the worst that would befal their
puppet would be banishment from the city and territory
of Geneva. If they could but cross and spite the
refugee Frenchman, their clerical tyrant, through the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">454</span>
fugitive Spaniard, their end would be attained, although
at the cost, perhaps, of a certain amount of inconvenience
to their instrument. The conclusion of Servetus’s
last address to the Council shows clearly the opinion
he had been led to form of Calvin’s present position
in Geneva. ‘As the magician he is,’ says Servetus,
‘he ought to be condemned, and cast out of your city,
his property being adjudged to me in recompense for
all I have lost through him!’ The Council appear
to have taken no more notice of this last address and
demand of their prisoner than they had of his preceding
more reasonable petitions and remonstrances.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The pause in the proceedings that ensued, pending
the receipt of replies from the Churches consulted;
the silence of the Council upon his letter and inculpation
of Calvin, combined with the effects of continued
imprisonment, anxiety, and hope deferred, on a body
not of the strongest, would seem before long to have
induced a frame of mind different from that so unmistakably
displayed of late by the prisoner. The petition
forwarded three weeks later to the Council is pitched
in a much lower key than the one last presented.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Most noble Lords,&mdash;It is now about three weeks since I
petitioned for an audience, and still have no reply. I entreat
you for the love of Jesus Christ not to refuse me that you
would grant to a Turk, when I ask for justice at your hands.
I have, indeed, things of importance to communicate to you,
very necessary to be known.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">455</span></p>

<p>As to what you may have commanded to be done for me
in the way of cleanliness, I have to inform you that nothing
has been done, and that I am in a more filthy plight than
ever. In addition, I suffer terribly from the cold, and from
colic, and my rupture, which cause me miseries of other kinds
I should feel shame in writing about more particularly. It
is very cruel that I am neither allowed to speak nor to have
my most pressing wants supplied; for the love of God, Sirs, in
pity or in duty, give orders in my behalf.</p>

<p class="author">
From your prison of Geneva,<br />
<span class="smcap">Michael Servetus</span>.</p>

<p>October 10, 1553.</p></blockquote>

<p>This appeal to the duty as well as the compassion
of the Council was the first of any he had addressed
to it which met with an immediate response. One of
the Syndics, attended by the Clerk of the Court, was
commissioned to visit the prisoner, and inquire into his
state, being requested, further, to see measures taken
to have him furnished with the articles of clothing he
required, so that the resolution formerly come to in
this direction should no longer remain a dead letter.</p>

<p><i>October 19 and 23.</i> A month had all but elapsed
before the messenger to the Councils and Churches of
the Protestant Swiss Cantons returned with the replies
of the Magistrates and Pastors to the Documents
submitted to them by the Council of Geneva. But he
came at last. As the answers were in Latin, translations
into French had to be made for the behoof of
those among the councillors of Geneva who were indifferently
versed in the Latin tongue. Some days
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">456</span>
more were required for this; so that though the messenger
arrived on October 19, the papers in Latin and
French were only ready on the 23rd, when they were
laid before the Council, once more solemnly assembled
in its judicial capacity, with the prisoner before them.</p>

<p>The Church of Berne which was the first referred
to [and had its head pastor, Haller, as reporter of its
conclusion?], blames Servetus not only for his heresies,
but for his insolence and want of respect for Calvin.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>He seems (says the report) to have thought himself at
liberty to call in question all the most essential elements of
our religion, to upset everything by new interpretations of
Scripture, and to corrupt and throw all into confusion by
reviving the poison of the ancient heresies.... We pray
that the Lord will give you such a spirit of prudence, of
counsel, and of strength, as will enable you to fence your
Church and the other Churches from this pestilence, and that
you will at the same time take no step that might be held
unbecoming in a Christian magistracy.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Church of Z&uuml;rich [of which Bullinger must
have been the reporter], replied at greater length
than that of Berne, or, indeed, any of the other
Churches, going minutely into the question of Servetus’s
opinions, which are pronounced to be at once heretical
and blasphemous. The Ministers of this Church are
particular also in insisting on the propriety of upholding
Calvin in his prosecution of the heretic.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We trust (say the pastors of Z&uuml;rich), that the faith and
zeal of Calvin, your pastor, and our brother, his noble devotion
to the refugees and the pious, will not be suffered by you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">457</span>
to be obscured by the unworthy accusations of this man,
against whom, indeed, we think you ought to show the greater
severity, inasmuch as our Churches have the evil reputation
abroad of countenancing heretics, and even of favouring heresy.
But the holy providence of God, they proceed, waxing in
fervour, presents you at this moment with an opportunity of
clearing yourselves as well as us, from such injurious imputations,
if you but resolve to show yourselves vigilant, and well
disposed to prevent the further spread of the poison. We
do not doubt, indeed, that your Excellencies will act in this
wise.</p></blockquote>

<p>Schaffhausen was content to subscribe to all that
had been said by Z&uuml;rich (whose conclusion, consequently,
had been communicated to it); but could not
resist insinuating how it thought the Spaniard should
be dealt with.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We do not doubt (say its Ministers) that you, with commendable
prudence, will so repress this attempt of Servetus,
that his blasphemies shall not be suffered to eat like a gangrene
into the limbs of Christ. To use lengthy reasonings with
a view to free him from his errors, would but be to rave with
a madman.</p></blockquote>

<p>The pastors of the Church of Basle [with Sulzer
as reporter], the last consulted, are rejoiced to see
Servetus in the hands of the magistrates of Geneva;
feeling persuaded that they will not be wanting either
in saintly zeal or Christian prudence, in finding a remedy
for an evil that has already led to the ruin of
vast numbers of souls. The theological culpability of
the man is also much aggravated in their opinion by
the obstinacy and insolence with which he persists in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">458</span>
his errors, instead of yielding to the reflections which
imprisonment and the instructions of the pastors of
Geneva ought to have led him to make.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We exhort you, therefore (they conclude), to use, as it
seems you are disposed to do, all the means at your command
to cure him of his errors, and so to remedy the scandals he
has occasioned; or, otherwise, does he show himself incurably
anchored in his perverse opinions, to constrain him, as is your
duty, by the powers you have from God, in such a way that
henceforth he shall not continue to disquiet the Church of
Christ, and so make the end worse than the beginning. The
Lord will surely grant you his spirit of wisdom and of
strength to this end.</p></blockquote>

<p>We thus see that the Churches, whilst they all agree
in condemning, refrain from declaring in precise terms
the kind of punishment they would have awarded the
prisoner&mdash;they do not in so many words say they
would have him put to death; but finding him guilty
of heresy and blasphemy, they knew that by the law of
the land he must die. Condemning him unequivocally,
therefore, for his theological views, they, in fact, pronounce
his doom. To have done so directly, would
have been trenching on the rights of the Council of
Geneva, by whom, under the circumstances, a covert
wish was sure to be better taken than an open recommendation.
And let us not overlook the base and
selfish motive that underlies the severity counselled:
by putting the heretical Spaniard to death, the Swiss
Churches will free themselves from the imputation of
favouring heresy!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">459</span></p>

<p>So much for the conclusions and implied wishes of
the Ministers. The Magistrates of the cities consulted,
differ but little, if at all, from their Clergy.
The Council of Berne express a hope that their brothers
of Geneva will not allow the wickedness and evil
intentions of their prisoner to make further head, all
he says being so manifestly opposed to the Christian
religion, which they think it must be his purpose to
vilipend and do what in him lies to exterminate.
They, therefore, ‘entreat the Senate of Geneva so to
comport themselves&mdash;and they do not question their
inclination in this&mdash;that such sectaries and disseminators
of error as their prisoner shall no longer be suffered
to sow in the Church of Christ.’</p>

<p>The reply of Berne is said by Calvin to have had
greater influence on the Judges of Servetus than that of
any of the other Councils. Geneva had oftener than
once in former years been indebted to Berne for assistance
in her straits, and still continued, to a considerable
extent, under the influence of the Canton that was looked
up to as Chief in the Swiss Confederation. The Magistrates
of Berne, moreover, were more outspoken,
perhaps, than those of any of the other Cantons.</p>

<p>But we discover, after all, that neither the Churches
nor Councils were acting independently and of knowledge
self-acquired of the business. The Clergy were
dominated by Calvin, the Councils by the Clergy;
and there appears to have been collusion and concert
among the reporters both of the Churches and Senates.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">460</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yesterday (September 26), (writes Haller of Berne, to
Bullinger of Z&uuml;rich) we received the documents in the case of
Servetus, and have since been studying them in view of our
reply. But we should like to know what your answer is
before we send ours. We therefore entreat you immediately to
inform us of its tenor. Yet wherefore so much ado! the man
is a heretic, and the Church must get rid of him. Let me,
however, I beseech you, speedily know the conclusion you
have come to.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Z&uuml;rich pastor would seem to have been the
most active of all the ministers in collecting and imparting
information of a kind that would lead to unanimity
of conclusion among the Churches and Councils.
His friend, Ambrose Blaurer, acknowledging receipt
of a letter from him communicating the decision of
Z&uuml;rich, says that he ‘had thought the pestilent Servetus,
whose book he had read twenty years ago, must
long since have been dead and buried.’ But the self-righteous
man must add further: ‘We are surely tried
by heresies and satanic abortions of the sort, in order
that they who are steadfast in the faith may be made
known.’ Sulzer of Basle has also been primed by him
of Z&uuml;rich, for, in reply to the intimation he has received
of what has been done, he says that he, Sulzer, ‘is
rejoiced to have heard of the arrest of Servetus in a
quarter where it seems he may be effectually kept
from infecting the Church with his heretical dogmas
in time to come; although I know there be some who
are violently opposed to Calvin’s proceedings, and the
subserviency of the Senate in the business.’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">461</span></p>

<p>So much for the Churches and Councils of the Cantons
consulted; and how little the latter were disposed
to act, or, indeed, were capable of acting of themselves,
and on their own appreciation of the questions submitted
to them, is made manifest by the letter which Haller
wrote to Bullinger at this time:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I have to give you my best thanks, dear Sir and Brother,
for your diligence in communicating with the Genevese [and,
of course, with the Bernese also] so speedily. Our Council
have been of the same mind as yours in their reply. We, <i>as
ordered by them</i>, have exposed the principal errors of Servetus,
article by article. When our Councillors had been made
aware of their nature, they were so horror-struck, that I have
no doubt, had the writer been in prison here, he would have
been burned alive. But as the matters in question were very
little intelligible to them, they desired that I should reply in
a letter as from myself to the Council of Geneva. They
added, however, from themselves, that they exhorted the
Genevese so to deal with the poison that it should not, by
any negligence of theirs, be suffered to spread to neighbouring
districts; and, indeed, it has often happened that commotions
in Geneva have extended from its walls and got footing within
ours. I think I need not send you a copy of our reply, as it
agrees so entirely in every respect with your own.</p>

<p class="author">
Yours most truly,<br />
<span class="smcap">J. Haller</span>.</p>

<p>Berne: October 19, 1553.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Churches and Councils consulted, then, were
at one in their condemnation of Servetus. But it has
been presumed that ecclesiastical conclusion and innuendo
backed by civilian assent, might still have failed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">462</span>
to bring matters to the issue aimed at by the prosecution,
had not political considerations intervened to complicate
and sway judicial action. We are ready enough
to believe that there was so much common sense in
the Senate of Geneva, and such a feeling of the impossibility
of attaining to absolute certainty in questions
of dogmatic theology, that they were even more
indisposed than they plainly show themselves to have
been to come to a final decision in the case of their
prisoner. But to assume that political considerations
had the lead in the condemnation of Servetus, would,
we venture to think, be a great mistake. To remove
the prosecution from the sphere of theology to that of
policy, were to take from it its chief interest and significance.
But the arrest was made, the trial was begun,
and the sentence was delivered exclusively on theological
grounds. The political element that got mixed
up with the business, was no more than an accident, and
cannot truly be said to have influenced the judgment
finally given. The four Swiss cantonal Councils and
Churches which condemned Servetus, condemned him
on theological grounds alone; they knew little or nothing
of the political strife that agitated Geneva, and
were not swayed by it in their decision.</p>

<p>Servetus himself, ill-advised and misled by those
who had access to him, fully persuaded of the truth of
his opinions, and relying on their consonance with
Scripture, as he read it, may be said to have left his
Judges one way only out of the difficult and delicate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">463</span>
position in which they found themselves; and this was
by finding him guilty of the theological errors laid to
his charge. He appeared to be opposed not only to
every religious principle as known to them, and as
understood alike by Catholics and Protestants, but he
had used such objectionable language in speaking of
subjects held so sacred as the Trinity and the Baptism
of Infants, that even the most tolerant in the present
day would find it inexcusable; how much less warrantable
must it have appeared amid the universally prevalent
intolerance of three centuries ago! Nevertheless, it
may be that the mind of every member of the Council
had not yet been made up as to the <i>degree</i> of the prisoner’s
guiltiness, or even granting him guilty of everything
imputed to him, that he, therefore, deserved to
die; and die he must if they so declared him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>All the grounds for a definitive decree being before
the Court on their meeting of the 23rd, we must
presume that the sense of the members generally as
to the guiltiness of the prisoner had been ascertained,
and that the opinion of the majority to this effect was
only not formulated and pronounced because of the
absence of some of the leading Councillors&mdash;that of
Amied Perrin, the first Syndic, being particularly remarked.
An adjournment was therefore moved; but
to afford no further excuse for delay in bringing the
protracted business of the Servetus Trial to an end,
summonses for a special session on the 26th were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">464</span>
ordered to be issued. Doubtful of the decision, as
it might seem, and anxious for delay in consequence
of the tenor of the letters from the Churches, Perrin
had absented himself from the meeting of the 23rd,
through indisposition, as he said himself, through
<i>feigned</i> indisposition, according to Calvin, as we learn
from a letter of his to his friend Farel of the 26th,
in which he speaks of his great political antagonist
by the derisive title of <i>C&aelig;sar comicus</i>. Meantime,
the members of the Court present determined to
proceed to the gaol, and inform the prisoner of their
purpose to have him before them with the least possible
delay, to hear their final award. Before taking their
leave, and as if to intimate to the unhappy Servetus
what was to follow, they placed him under the care
of two special warders, who were to hold themselves
responsible with their lives for his safe custody.</p>

<p>The unusual visit of his Judges, and the additional
guard set over him must, we should imagine, have
sent a chill to the heart of the unfortunate Servetus,
and gone far to damp out the hope he had been
led to entertain either of acquittal or a sentence short
of that which he knew Calvin had made up his mind
from the first to extort. Yet does he not appear even
now to have thought it possible that his Judges would
condemn him to death. Self-conscious rectitude alone,
and a better belief than it deserved in the world’s will
to do justly and mercifully, had blinded him to the fate
that awaited him.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">465</span></p>

<p>During the three days’ pause that now ensued, some
faint show of sympathy for the prisoner was manifested
outside the walls of the Council chamber; but it came
from no one of weight or standing in the Republic.
Zebedee, the pastor of Noyon, a known opponent of
Calvin on some of his theological tenets, and Gribaldo,
an Italian by birth, by profession a lawyer, now a refugee
from his home for conscience’ sake, were bold
enough to proffer something in his behalf; Gribaldo
even going so far as to defend certain of his conclusions,
and having a word to say in favour of toleration. But
he was not backed by the congregation of his countrymen,
domiciled in Geneva, so that the move he made
had no result. The show of opposition on the part of
the Italian to his sovereign will and pleasure was not,
however, forgotten by Calvin. Denounced by him at
a later period for irregularity of some sort, in contravention
of consistorial law, Gribaldo found it advisable
for safety’s sake to quit Geneva.</p>

<p>Still there were not wanting many, both laymen
and clerics, natives of Geneva, as well as refugees, devoutly
attached to Calvinistic doctrines, who showed a
lively repugnance to pushing matters the length of
capital punishment in cases of heresy; the instinctive
feeling of all pointing to this as the conclusion aimed at
by the prosecution. For Reformers&mdash;heretics themselves
in the eyes of the dominant European Church&mdash;to
have recourse to measures that appeared in such an
odious light when brought into requisition by Roman
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">466</span>
Catholics, seemed illogical, unwarrantable, and dangerous.
But the number who raised their voices in this
direction was small. The prisoner was not an object
of interest to the Libertine party in general; a stranger
in Geneva, he was in some sort the particular puppet
of Perrin and Berthelier, rather than the representative
of a principle. Even to the leaders he was nothing
more than a counter in the political game of the day.
In a word, and in so far as anything was known about
him to the public, the man entertained extraordinary,
and what seemed blasphemous opinions on religion,
as they had learned to understand the word, and
so must be a wicked and worthless person, who might
safely be left to be dealt with by the ministers and
civil authorities in the way they judged best.</p>

<p>Calvin, at this momentous juncture, maintained an
attitude of entire confidence as to the pending decision.
He had been informed of the tenor of the letters received
from the Swiss cities; and, aware of their uniform
agreement in the theological culpability of Servetus,
he could rely on the effect this must produce on
the minds of the Judges. He seems even to have
thought it unnecessary any longer to exert the special
influence he could always bring to bear on any question
in debate before the Council&mdash;he refrained from
preaching against the prisoner and holding him up as
a blasphemer against God and religion, as had been
his wont.</p>

<p><i>October 26.</i>&mdash;The Council, in its capacity of High
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">467</span>
Court of Criminal Justice, solemnly convoked for
this day, was well attended, though not quite complete
as to numbers; Amied Perrin, cured of his indisposition,
presiding.</p>

<p>The Governing Body of the Republic of Geneva
consisted, as we have seen, of two extreme and mutually
opposed parties&mdash;the Libertines, or patriots, and
the Clericals, or abettors of Calvin and theocratic rule.
Each of these had representatives in the Council whose
voices could be implicitly relied on. But&mdash;as in all
general assemblies that ever came together, there are
still found a certain number of neutrals or waverers,
men of no strong convictions one way or another; too
weak in some cases to rely on themselves and act
independently; too strong in others to be led by any
convictions but their own, whose votes could make
the balance incline one way or another, so were they
not wanting in the Council of Geneva at this time.
Now, in the fateful meeting of October 26, it was observed
that several of the most constant opponents of
Calvin had absented themselves, whilst not one of his
regular supporters failed to appear.</p>

<p>The resolution to be come to was delicate, on
matters unfamiliar, and apt to excite the scruples of the
conscientious and timid. It was the life of no brutal
offender against person or property, no criminal, in
fact, save by construction, that was in debate, but
that of a scholar of varied accomplishments, against
whom no social delinquency had been charged, or, if
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">468</span>
charged, which had not been rebutted, and fallen to the
ground. Yet was this man accused of heresy and
blasphemy against God and religion, not only by the
distinguished head of the Church of Geneva and its
other ministers, but was now found guilty of these
theological crimes, involving, as they were said to do,
disruption of the entire social fabric, by every one
of the Confederate Churches and Councils consulted.
What, forsooth, could be urged in behalf of him who
had spoken of the Trinity as a three-headed monster,
comparable to the hell-dog of the heathen poets, and
declared the Baptism of Infants to be an invention
of the devil?</p>

<p>And then, and yet more, it was not by the Reformed
Churches only that the prisoner had been
challenged for heresy, and found guilty; he had been
tried and convicted on this ground by their neighbours
the Roman Catholics of Vienne, been burned in
effigy by them along with his books, and only escaped
burning in person by breaking from his prison. The
Genevese, moreover, had been frequently reproached
as well by papists as by professors of other forms of
Christianity akin to their own, with laxity in matters
of doctrine, and even called abettors of heresy and
shelterers of heretics; and they had, indeed, been invaded
of late by a host of individuals fleeing for their
lives, through entertaining all manner of new and
hitherto unheard-of opinions on religion.</p>

<p>Weary on every side of wranglings upon subjects
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">469</span>
they did not understand, the clerical party in the
Senate would not be thought less than zealous for the
true Faith&mdash;the Faith which was their own; whilst the
more timid of their adversaries sought excuse and escape
from responsibility by absenting themselves at the
moment the vote must be given on the guilt or innocence
of the prisoner. But everything at the moment
conspired to associate theological dissidence with social
criminality, and to make of the independent critic of
particular religious dogmas the enemy of all religion.</p>

<p>In the light, therefore, in which Servetus was regarded,
his cause was not seen as one through which,
in the event of a decision in his favour, the Liberal
party in the Council of Geneva might hope to find
greater freedom to lead their lives in the way they
listed; neither, through a sentence adverse to him, was
it one through which they foresaw that the iron hand
of Calvin would be made either lighter or heavier
than it was. There were, in fact, more reasons for
letting Calvin have his way here than for opposing
him&mdash;for suffering Servetus to burn, than for saving
his life. The Council had been hard upon the Reformer
of late, and were not disposed to quarrel with
him in a matter that had but a remote connection with
their domestic concerns. Backed as their great theologian
was by the Swiss Churches, they believed that
they might safely and with propriety now show themselves
on his side, by condemning the heretic to
death.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">470</span></p>

<p>The meeting of the Court on the 26th, then, not so
fully attended as we have said by the usual opponents
of Calvin as by his supporters, had to face the painful
duty of pronouncing sentence on their prisoner at last.
A resolution finding him guilty of the charges alleged,
and so deserving of death, must now have
been moved by one of the members&mdash;by whom we
are not informed&mdash;for we find it immediately met, on
the part of Perrin, by a counter-resolution, declaring
him not guilty. Perrin, we must presume, maintained
that the charges were not of a nature that fell properly
under their cognisance as a Court of Criminal Justice.
Nothing had been brought home to the prisoner that
showed him to be a disturber of the public peace, and
so came within the sphere of what he held to be their
proper jurisdiction. Perrin must, therefore, have argued
that the Court could only pronounce him not guilty.
But this would plainly have been to stultify the whole
of their proceedings during the last two months and
more. The Court, by the laws of the country, was
competent in causes of every complexion, and the
prosecution had proceeded from the first on the ground
of theological criminality. The proposition of the
First Syndic, consequently, could not be entertained,
but was rejected as a matter of course. Perrin then
moved that the cause should be remitted to the
Council of the Two Hundred. But this proposal was
also negatived: the General Council in its capacity of
Criminal Court, could not waive its right of decision in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">471</span>
a case in which its competence was recognised, and
such ample pains had been taken to get at the merits
of the case. Perrin must then, doubtless, have pleaded
for some punishment short of the extreme penalty of
death awarded to the heretic by the law of the land.
This last effort failing like the others, and the Records
of the Court giving no intimation of any further
motion in favour of the prisoner, the following
resolution was moved, and by a majority of votes
adopted:</p>

<p>‘Having a summary of the process against the
prisoner, Michael Servetus, and the reports of the
parties consulted before us, it is hereby resolved, and,
in consideration of his great errors and blasphemies,
decreed, that he be taken to Champel, and there burned
alive; that this sentence be carried into effect on the
morrow, and that his books be burned with him.’<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a></p>

<p>The sentence once resolved on, appears to have been
immediately communicated to Calvin, and he in the
same hour proceeded to inform his most intimate friend
Farel of the result. In anticipation of the event, he
had, indeed, written to Farel some days before, begging
him to come to Geneva. The clergy of the city having
acted with Calvin to a man in the prosecution, it was
thought more seemly that a stranger should attend the
prisoner in his last moments, than one of themselves;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">472</span>
hence Calvin’s first letter of October 14, in anticipation
of the final sentence, and to the following effect:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I have no words, my dear Farel, adequately to express my
thanks to you for your great solicitude in respect of ourself
and our Church. I purposely abstained from writing to you
for fear of inducing you to take horse so soon (Farel had
been dangerously ill), and I would not be troublesome to you
until time pressed. You say, indeed, that you do not thank
me for sparing you; and I know how willing, nay, how eager
you are at all times to labour for the Church of God, how
ready ever to come to our aid.</p>

<p>As to the state of affairs with us, I imagine you are already
well informed, through Viret, or rather through my letters to
him, which, however, were really meant for you both in common.
The enemy is now intent on the business that
comes on for discussion before the General Council about the
Ides of November, and I think it would be well were Viret to
come to us then; but I would have you here somewhat sooner&mdash;about
the time when the affair of Servetus will be drawing to
a close; and this I hope will be before the end of the ensuing
week.... I would not, however, incommode you, or have
you stir, where no immediate necessity compels.</p></blockquote>

<p>Farel had not arrived so soon as Calvin expected,
so he writes again on the 26th, and informs his friend that
answers had been received from the Churches unanimous
in their condemnation of Servetus. Alluding to the
proceedings during the last few days of the trial, when
Perrin, the First Syndic, made vain attempts by delay
and entreaty to save the prisoner’s life, Calvin speaks
of the merciful man by the nickname under which he
was wont to characterise his great Libertine opponent,
and says:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">473</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Our comical C&aelig;sar having feigned illness for three days,
mounted the tribune at length with a view to aid the wicked
scoundrel&mdash;<i>istum sceleratum</i>&mdash;to escape punishment. Nor did
he blush to demand that the cause might be remitted to the
Council of the Two Hundred. But in vain, all was refused,
the prisoner was condemned, and to-morrow he will suffer
death.</p></blockquote>

<p>Self-centred, resolute as he was, we yet see in
Calvin’s anxiety to have Farel beside him, that he felt
the want of such support as an all-devoted friend alone
can give in supreme moments of our lives. His last
letter could not have reached Farel in such time as
would have enabled him to be in Geneva on the day
of the execution; but when it was despatched Farel
was already on his way from Neuchatel, and reached
Geneva in the evening of the 26th, so that he had the
news of all that had taken place, and of the fate that
awaited the unhappy Servetus on the morrow, from the
mouth of Calvin himself.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">474</span></p>

<h2 id="BOOK_II_CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<p class="center">THE ATTITUDE OF CALVIN&mdash;THE HOPES OF SERVETUS.</p>

<p>Informed of the decree of the Court, Calvin tells us
that he bestirred himself to have the sentence carried
out in the way usual in criminal cases, by beheading
with the sword, instead of burning by slow fire. The
heretic must be got rid of, he must die, but the Reformer
would give a civil rather than an ecclesiastical
complexion to the business, and escape imitation of the
Roman Catholic cruel mode of putting God’s enemies,
as heretics were called, to death. The Council, however,
did not enter into his views. The Canon Law,
still in force over Europe, condemned the convicted
heretic to death by fire, and the majority of the Court
determined to abide by the statute as it stood. Bigotry
and intolerance, fanned to fever heat, were in the ascendant,
and would forego none of their most terrible
means of punishing the offender, and striking terror
into the vulgar mind. The oblation in such cases provided,
would even have appeared to lose its significance,
had it been presented otherwise than as ‘a sacrifice of
a sweet savour made by fire to the Lord’; for still influenced
by the ritual of the old Hebrew Law, which,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">475</span>
in earlier days, required the first-born of man and
beast for the altar, and had criminals of all sorts ‘hung
up before the sun,’ lives forfeited for theological errors,
were, in reality, offerings to appease the wrath or win
the favour of the Supreme!</p>

<p>Servetus, meanwhile, made aware that the trial was
at an end, and that nothing more remained for him but
to learn his fate, though he may have been alarmed
by the additional measures taken for his safe custody,
seems not yet, as we have said, to have abandoned the
persuasion that he would either be acquitted or subjected
to some minor or merely nominal penalty. He
was not conscience-stricken; he knew himself guilty of
no impiety or intentional blasphemy; his object from
first to last had been to present what he thought were
higher, truer views of the Revelation which he believed
God had made of himself to mankind in the olden time
in Jud&aelig;a; and the proclaimed purpose of his latest
work, as he said himself to his Judges, was the <i>Restoration</i>,
not the destruction of Christianity. More than
this: he was not now among Papists bound to intolerance
by their creed, but among Protestants in Geneva&mdash;the
stronghold of free thought and its necessary logical
adjunct, toleration; among men who had studied,
reasoned, and, like himself, put their own construction
on writings which he as well as they believed to be the
Word of God. And then, had he not all along been
upheld by Perrin and Berthelier, in the belief of triumphing
over his persecutor? How should hopes of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">476</span>
longer life in view of further effort in the cause that
was dear to him, and of freedom to shape out thoughts
on matters high and holy, have forsaken him? True,
Calvin had aimed at his life through the people of
Vienne; and in his present bonds, and all the unworthy
usage he suffered, he could not fail to realise the persistent
hostility of the man who held him in such despite.
Still he was in Geneva, though a prisoner, and
Calvin was not all in all within that Republican city.
There was a powerful party opposed to the tyranny and
self-assertion of the ecclesiastic, the distinguished heads
of which gave him their countenance and support&mdash;there
seemed hardly room for doubt: he would not be
found guilty of having blasphemed, but would be acquitted
and set at liberty.</p>

<p>Cherishing such hopes and so supported, are we to
wonder that the Sentence of Death took the unhappy
Servetus entirely by surprise? Only imparted to him
in the early morning of the day on which he was
doomed to die, he was at first as if struck dumb by the
intelligence. He did but groan aloud and sigh as if his
heart would burst; and when he recovered speech at
length, it was only to rave like one demented, to strike
his breast, and cry in his native Spanish, Misericordia,
Misericordia! By degrees, however, he recovered his
self-possession and became more calm. Master of himself,
and reverting in thought to his pursuer, his first
coherent words were to request an interview with
Calvin, which he, we need not doubt, was nowise slow
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">477</span>
to grant, for he must have thought it both a flattering
and a hopeful proposal. Now had the sinner come to
his senses; now would he make a clean breast of it,
abjure the convictions of his life, and with a lie on
his lips be made meet for glory! But nothing of all
this was in the mind of Servetus. He had no misgivings
about his theological conclusions; in these he
was securely anchored; but he felt like a true man in
the face of impending fate, and would own that he had
not comported himself with all the respect that was
rightfully due to his theological opponent. Hence his
request for the interview.</p>

<p>Accompanied by two of the Councillors, Calvin entered
the prison an hour or two before noon of the
fateful October 27, 1553, and prefacing the account he
has left us of what transpired at the meeting, by saying
that Servetus had received the notice of his sentence
and impending doom with a ‘sort of brutish
stupidity&mdash;<i>cum belluina stupiditate</i>,’ he proceeds: ‘I
asked him what he wanted with me&mdash;<i>quidnam vellet?</i>
To which he replied, that he desired to ask my pardon.’
I then said that I had never prosecuted anyone
on merely personal grounds; that I had admonished
him with all the gentleness I could command as
many as sixteen years ago, and not without danger to
my own life had spared no pains to cure him of his
errors. But all in vain! my expostulations appeared
rather to excite his bile. Quitting speech of myself,
however, I then desired him rather to ask pardon of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">478</span>
the Eternal God, towards whom he had shown himself
but too contumelious, presuming, as he had done,
to take from his Essence the three hypostases that
pertain to it; and saying that were it possible to
show a personal distinction between the Father, Son,
and Holy Ghost, we should have a three-headed Cerberus
for a God; with much beside that need not now
be repeated. Seeing, ere long, that all I said went for
nothing, and feeling indisposed to trespass on the time
of the Magistrates, or to appear something more than
my Master, in obedience to the precept of Paul, I took
my leave of the heretic, αὐτοκατάκριτος&mdash;self-condemned.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></p>

<p>But there is a deep-lying truth in the French
adage: ‘Qui s’excuse s’accuse&mdash;<i>he who excuses accuses
himself</i>.’ The first impulse of the tolerant Servetus,
on coming to his senses, was to ask pardon of the man
who had brought him to his death; the first impulse
of the implacable Calvin was to apologise for his deed,
and to shift to a sense of public duty, a course to which
his secret soul informed him he had been mainly
prompted by private hate. Nor is that which Calvin
connects with his apology, when he speaks of having
imperilled his life for Servetus’s sake, to be received
as true in fact. That he would have braved any
danger that might have accompanied the public discussion
of their opinions proposed by Servetus in
1534, we can well believe; but he was not required
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">479</span>
to face it, and all their subsequent correspondence,
private and confidential as it was, could have been
attended with peril neither to him nor Servetus&mdash;or
if to either it must have been to Servetus had he
been discovered in correspondence with the arch-heretic
of Geneva. We can hardly imagine Calvin to have
been so totally devoid of humanity as to have felt no
compunctious visitings when he stood face to face with
the man whom his persistent enmity alone had brought
to such a pass; but he would also have been other
than he meets us in history, and otherwise circumstanced
than he was as αὐτοκράτωρ&mdash;despot of Geneva&mdash;had
he not felt something of self-gratulation and
even of triumph, when pardon was asked of him by
his humbled foe.

<h2 id="BOOK_II_CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<p class="center">THE SENTENCE AND EXECUTION.</p>

<p>An hour before noon of October 27, 1553, the
‘Lieutenant Criminel,’ Tissot, accompanied by other
officials and a guard, entered the gaol, and ordered the
prisoner to come with them, and learn the pleasure of
My Lords the Councillors and Justices of Geneva.</p>

<p>The tribunal, in conformity with custom, now assembled
before the porch of the Hotel de Ville, received
the prisoner, all standing. The proper officer
then proceeded to recapitulate the heads of the process
against him, Michael Servetus, of Villanova, in the
Kingdom of Aragon, in Spain, in which he is charged&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>First</i>: with having, between twenty-three and twenty-four
years ago, caused to be printed at Hagenau, in Germany, a
book against the Holy Trinity, full of blasphemies, to the
great scandal of the Churches of Germany, the book having
been condemned by all their doctors, and he, the writer, forced
to fly that country. <i>Item.</i> With having, in spite of this, not
only persisted in his errors and infected many with them,
but with having lately had another book clandestinely printed
at Vienne in Dauphiny, filled with the like heresies and execrable
blasphemies against the Holy Trinity, the Son of God,
the Baptism of Infants, and other sacred doctrines, the foundations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">481</span>
of the Christian religion. <i>Item.</i> With having in the
said book called all who believe in a Trinity, Tritheists, and
even Atheists, and the Trinity itself a d&aelig;mon or monster
having three heads. <i>Item.</i> With having blasphemed horribly,
and said that Jesus Christ was not the Son of God from all
Eternity, but only became so from his Incarnation; that he
is not the Son of David according to the flesh, but was created
of the substance of God, having received three of his constituent
elements from God, and one only from the Virgin Mary,
whereby he wickedly proposed to abolish the true and entire
humanity of Jesus Christ. <i>Item.</i> With declaring the Baptism
of Infants to be sorcery and a diabolical invention. <i>Item.</i> With
having uttered other blasphemies, with which the book in
question is full, all alike against the Majesty of God, the Son
of God, and the Holy Ghost, to the ruin of many poor souls,
betrayed and desolated by such detestable doctrines. <i>Item.</i>
With having, full of malice, entitled the said book, though
crammed with heresies against the holy evangelical doctrine,
‘Christianismi Restitutio&mdash;the Restoration of Christianity,’ the
better to deceive and seduce poor ignorant folks, poisoning
them all the while they fancied they were sitting in the shadow
of sound doctrine. <i>Item.</i> With attacking our faith by letters
as well as by his book, and saying to one of the ministers of
this city that our holy evangelical doctrine is a religion
without faith, and indeed without God, we having a Cerberus
with three heads, for our God. <i>Item.</i> For having perfidiously
broken and escaped from the prison of Vienne, where he had
been confined because of the wicked and abominable opinions
confessed in his book. <i>Item.</i> For continuing obstinate in his
opinions, not only against the true Christian religion, but, as
an arrogant innovator and inventor of heresies against Popery,
which led to his being burned in effigy at Vienne, along with
five bales of his book. <i>Item.</i> And in addition to all of which,
being confined in the gaol of this city, he has not ceased
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">482</span>
maliciously to persist in the aforesaid wicked and detestable
errors, attempting to maintain them, with calumnious abuse of
all true Christians, faithful followers of the immaculate Christian
religion, calling them Tritheists, Atheists, and Sorcerers,
in spite of the remonstrances made to him in Germany, as
said, and in contempt of the reprehensions and corrections
he has received, and the imprisonment he has undergone as
well here as elsewhere.</p>

<p>Now, we the Syndics and Judges in criminal cases within
this city, having reviewed the process carried on before us, at
the instance of our Lieutenant having charge of such cases,
against thee, Michael Servetus of Villanova, in the Kingdom
of Aragon, in Spain, whereby guided, and by thy voluntary
confessions made before us, many times repeated, as well as by
thy books produced before us, we decree and determine that
thou, Michael Servetus, hast, for a long time, promulgated false
and heretical doctrine, and, rejecting all remonstrance and
correction, hast, maliciously, perversely, and obstinately, continued
disseminating and divulging, even by the printing of
books, blasphemies against God the Father, the Son, and the
Holy Ghost, in a word, against the whole foundations of
the Christian religion, thereby seeking to create schism and
trouble in the Church of God, many souls, members of which
may have been ruined and lost&mdash;horrible and dreadful thing,
scandalous and contaminating in thee, thou, having no shame
nor horror in setting thyself up in all against the Divine
Majesty and the Holy Trinity, and having further taken pains
to infect, and given thyself up obstinately to continue infecting
the world with thy heresies and stinking heretical poison
(<i>tes heresies et puante poyson hereticale</i>)&mdash;case and crime of
heresy grievous and detestable, deserving of severe corporal
punishment.</p>

<p>These and other just causes moving us, desiring to purge
the Church of God of such infection, and to cut off from it so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">483</span>
rotten a member, we, sitting as a Judicial Tribunal in the seat
of our ancestors, with the entire assent of the General Council
of the State, and our fellow-citizens, calling on the name of
God to deliver true judgment, having the Holy Scriptures
before us, and saying: In the name of the Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost, we now pronounce our final sentence and condemn
thee, Michael Servetus, to be bound and taken to Champel,
and there being fastened to a stake, to be burned alive, along
with thy books, printed as well as written by thy hand, until
thy body be reduced to ashes. So shall thy days end, and
thou be made an example to others who would do as thou
hast done. And we command you, our Lieutenant, to see
this our sentence carried forthwith into execution.</p></blockquote>

<p>The staff, according to custom, was then broken
over the prisoner, and there was silence for a moment.</p>

<p>The terrible sentence pronounced, the pause that
followed was first broken by Servetus; not to sue for
mercy against the final award, from which he knew there
was no appeal, but to entreat that the manner of carrying
it out might be commuted for one less dreadful. ‘He
feared,’ he said, ‘that through excess of suffering he
might prove faithless to himself, and belie the convictions
of his life. If he had erred, it was in ignorance;
he was so constituted mentally and morally as to desire
the glory of God, and had always striven to abide by
the teachings of the Scriptures.’ The appeal to the
humanity of the Judges, however, met with no response.
Farel, indeed, who was present, interposed, telling him
that to obtain any favour he should begin by acknowledging
and showing contrition for his errors. But he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">484</span>
gave no heed to this, and went on to say that ‘he had
done nothing to deserve death; he prayed God,
nevertheless, to forgive his enemies and persecutors.’
Rising from the suppliant attitude he had assumed, he
exclaimed, ‘O God, save my soul; O Jesu, Son of the
eternal God, have compassion upon me!’</p>

<p>From the porch of the Hotel de Ville, where the
sentence was delivered, a solemn procession was now
formed for Champel, the place of execution, passing by
the Rue St. Antoine, and leaving the city by the corresponding
gate: the ‘Lieutenant Criminel,’ and other
officers on horseback, a guard of archers surrounding
the prisoner and Farel, who accompanied him on his
death walk, and did not cease from efforts to wring
from him an avowal of his errors. But in vain; he
had no answer other than broken ejaculations and invocations
on the name of God. ‘Is there no word in
your mouth but the name of God?’ said Farel. ‘On
whom can I now call but on God?’ said the unhappy
Servetus. ‘Have you no last words for anyone&mdash;for
wife or child, perhaps, if you have either?’ said the
well-meaning pastor; but he met with no reply; though
when admonished to do so, the doomed man made no
difficulty about asking the people to join him in his
prayers. This gave Farel an opportunity to say to
the crowd, ‘You see what power Satan has when he has
taken possession of the soul. This is a learned man,
who perhaps even meant to do well; but he fell into
the power of the devil, and the same thing might
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">485</span>
happen to any one of you. Though he has said that
you have no God, he yet asks you to join him in his
prayers!’</p>

<p>But this is not all we have on the last moments of
Servetus. Writing to his friend, Ambrose Blaurer, soon
after the fatal October 27, Farel says, ‘You ask me
about Servetus, so justly punished by a pious magistracy.
I was at Geneva when the sentence was delivered,
and with him when he died. The wretched
man could not be brought to say that Christ was the
Eternal Son of God. When I urged him on the
subject, he desired me to point to a single place in the
Scriptures in which Christ is spoken of as the Son of
God before his birth. All that could be done had no
effect in turning him from this error; he said nothing
against what was urged, but went on his way; we
could by no means obtain what we desired, viz., that
he should own his error and acknowledge the truth.
We exhorted, we entreated, but made no impression.
He beat his breast, asked pardon for his faults, invoked
God, confessed his Saviour, and much besides, but
would not acknowledge the Son of God, save in the
man Jesus. Nor was I alone in my exhortations; some
of the brethren also interposed, and admonished him
ingenuously to admit and say that he hated his errors;
but he only replied that he was unjustly condemned to
death. On this I said: “Do you, who have so greatly
sinned, presume to justify yourself? If you go on
thus I shall leave you to the judgment of God, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">486</span>
accompany you no farther. I meant to exhort the
people to pray for you, hoping you would edify them;
and thought not to leave you till you had rendered your
last breath.” After this he said nothing more of himself,
although when I spoke of the Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost, whom we preach in our churches, and in
whom the faithful believe, he said that it was right and
good to do so; but when I went on to say that he did
not really think thus, and had written otherwise, he
would not admit it. He told me by the way that he
had had some things from a man who enjoyed no small
reputation among some of us. But though I do not
doubt of Erasmus having been infected in no trifling
degree by the writings of the Rabbins, I know that
in his later works at least he expresses himself otherwise
than in those of earlier date. But the unhappy
Servetus could not readily be made to imbibe the truth
and put it to increase; neither could he be cured of his
errors by the sound teaching of others.</p>

<p>‘It were long did I repeat&mdash;I do not think, indeed,
I can remember&mdash;all that was said between seven in
the morning and mid-day. In sum, however, although
he made no particular confession of his faith, God hindered
his name and doctrine from being impugned by
any open contumelious expression.’</p>

<p>When he came in sight of the fatal pile, the
wretched Servetus prostrated himself on the ground,
and for a while was absorbed in prayer. Rising and
advancing a few steps, he found himself in the hands
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">487</span>
of the executioner, by whom he was made to sit on a
block, his feet just reaching the ground. His body
was then bound to the stake behind him by several turns
of an iron chain, whilst his neck was secured in like
manner by the coils of a hempen rope. His two books&mdash;the
one in manuscript sent to Calvin in confidence six
or eight years before for his strictures, and a copy of
the one lately printed at Vienne&mdash;were then fastened to
his waist, and his head was encircled in mockery with a
chaplet of straw and green twigs bestrewed with brimstone.
The deadly torch was then applied to the
faggots and flashed in his face; and the brimstone
catching, and the flames rising, wrung from the victim
such a cry of anguish as struck terror into the surrounding
crowd. After this he was bravely silent;
but the wood being purposely green, although the
people aided the executioner in heaping the faggots
upon him, a long half-hour elapsed before he ceased to
show signs of life and of suffering. Immediately before
giving up the ghost, with a last expiring effort he cried
aloud: ‘Jesu, Thou Son of the eternal God, have compassion
upon me!’ All was then hushed save the
hissing and crackling of the green wood; and by-and-by
there remained no more of what had been Michael
Servetus but a charred and blackened trunk and a
handful of ashes. So died, in advance of his age, one
of the gifted sons of God, the victim of religious fanaticism
and personal hate.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">488</span></p>

<h2 id="BOOK_II_CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<p class="center">AFTER THE BATTLE&mdash;V&AElig; VICTORIBUS!</p>

<p>Even before the trial of Servetus had come to an end
we have seen it attracting the attention of some of
the freer minds of Geneva&mdash;such as were not over-awed
by the dominant spirit of Calvin or not absorbed
in the political strife of the hour. A criminal suit on
the ground of a new interpretation of Scripture, as it
had been made in fine so clearly to appear, struck reasonable
men not only as illogical but as indefensible in a
city whose autonomy and entire religious system were
founded on a right of the kind assumed by itself.
Calvin’s dictum, that Servetus’s purpose was the overthrow
of all religion, was not seen to be borne out by
the facts of the case when calmly considered, and, to
the popular apprehension, was wholly belied by the
pious bearing of the man in the last hours of his life.
Even Farel, misled as he was by his fanaticism,
could not help saying to the people, that ‘after all the
man may have meant well.’</p>

<p>The protracted trial at an end, the sacrifice made,
the Councillors of Geneva seem immediately to have
come to their senses, and discovered that they had transgressed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">489</span>
the true limits of their authority in condemning
to death one who owed them no allegiance, who
had been guilty of no crime or misdemeanour whether
within the bounds of their jurisdiction or elsewhere,
and whose heresies implied no rejection of the Scriptures
as the Word of God, or of the teaching of
Christ and his Apostles as the means of salvation.
Servetus’s heresy amounted to no more than repudiation
of what he maintained to be erroneous interpretations
of the language of the Gospels, of metaphysical assumptions
from heathen philosophies, and mystical
procedures unwarranted by a line whether of the Old
or the New Testament. They overlooked the fact
that the presence of the man among them was due to
flight from the fate that waited on all who had the
courage of their opinions amid the blood-stained intolerance
of Roman Catholicism; that he was only
another among the host of refugees&mdash;their spiritual
Dictator himself not excepted&mdash;who now crowded the
streets of Geneva; and that, but for the hostile interference
of Calvin, he, like so many more, would have
been welcomed as ‘a bird escaped from the net of
the fowler;’ sheltered had he elected to remain, furthered
on his way had he chosen to depart.</p>

<p>That thoughts of the kind had taken possession of
the Council is proclaimed by the fact of their quashing
the indictment preferred by Farel and the Consistory
against Geroult, Arnoullet’s foreman, three
days after the death of Servetus, on the score of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">490</span>
part he had had in printing the ‘Restitutio Christianismi,’
and concealing the character of its contents from
his master. Farel and the clergy in their blind zeal
would have persevered in their efforts to have another
victim. But the civilians interposed. Enough&mdash;more
than enough had already been done to satisfy the
outer world that the Genevese, if reputed heretics
themselves, were no favourers of heresy of another
complexion than their own. Left to calm reflection,
the Council may well have come to see that they had
only lent themselves to theological intolerance, when
they imagined they were fulfilling an important part
of their magisterial duties.</p>

<p>The entire ground, indeed, on which the trial had
been instituted would not bear close scrutiny. The
book, on the presumed publication and dissemination
of which it had been set on foot, had not yet been
seen in Geneva save by Calvin: there was not then
another copy in the city but the one sent, as I believe,
by its hapless author through Frelon to the Reformer.
Neither had the ostensible institutor of the suit,
Nicolas de la Fontaine, the shadow of a grievance
against Michael Servetus, the writer of the book.
He could never have seen it out of Calvin’s hands, he
was almost certainly unacquainted with the language
in which it was written, and, if he were not, he could
still never have read a word of it but at Calvin’s
prompting&mdash;he had not, in all probability, even heard
the name of Servetus until he had it from the mouth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">491</span>
of his master! De la Fontaine, moreover, was no
citizen of Geneva any more than Calvin himself<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a>&mdash;neither
of them could have had a legal title to prefer
a criminal charge; master and man were aliens alike,
and in Geneva on the same plea as Servetus; they
fleeing for their lives from the Inquisitors and agents
of the concubine of Henry of France, he from the Inquisitor
and Church authorities of Dauphiny.</p>

<p>More than this. ‘He,’ it is said, ‘who casts the first
stone should be himself without sin.’ Calvin pursued
Servetus to death mainly on the ground of his divergent
interpretation of the Trinitarian mystery. But
was Calvin himself quite sound on this head, and was
he equally hostile to all who called the dogma in
question? We have had him saying that he only
objected to speak of God and Nature as signifying
the same thing, because of the harshness or impropriety
of the expression. But he who so delivers himself
identifies God and the Universe, and excludes
ideas of personality and subdivision in the essence
of the Deity. No wonder, therefore, that Calvin
was oftener than once charged with unorthodoxy from
the Catholic point of view on the subject of the
Trinity. In the Confession of Faith which he formulated
for the Church of Geneva in the year 1536, it
is certain that neither the word Trinity nor the word
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">492</span>
Person is to be found;<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> and when challenged at a
later period by Caroli, the colleague of Viret at Lausanne,
on the matter, he did not so express himself as
to satisfy his accuser. In a remarkable note, moreover,
‘On the word Trinity and the word Persons,’
written apparently to meet the surmises suggested by
the absence of the sacred vocables from the Confession,
Calvin says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘Inasmuch as these words, ‘Trinity’ and ‘Persons,’ are
found by us to be very serviceable in the Church of Christ,
as by them the true distinction of the Father, Son, and Holy
Spirit is more clearly expressed, and controversial discussions
are better served by their means, we say that we have no such
objection to them as forbids us to receive them from others
or to make use of them ourselves. Therefore, do we again
declare, as we have formerly declared, that we accept the
words, and would not that they ceased to be used in the
Churches. For neither in our expositions of the Scriptures or
when preaching to the people do we shun them; and we
have instructed others [in private]&mdash;<i>docebimus alios</i>, that they
should not superstitiously avoid them. Did anyone, however,
from religious scruples, feel indisposed to make use of the
words&mdash;although we avow that such superstition is not
approved by us, and we shall continue striving to correct it&mdash;still,
this seems no sufficient reason why a man, otherwise
pious and having like religious views as ourselves, should be
rejected. His want of better knowledge in this direction
ought not to carry us the length of casting him out of the
Church, or lead us to conclude that he was therefore altogether
unsound in the faith. Neither, meantime, are we to think
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">493</span>
evilly of the Pastors of the Church of Berne, if they refuse to
admit anyone to the ministry who declines to use the words.’<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a></p></blockquote>

<p>We leave the reader to draw his own conclusions
from this, and only ask him to say, on its showing,
what excuse can be found for Calvin’s deed in burning
Servetus? Scattered throughout the writings of the
Genevese Reformer we encounter many expressions
which prove plainly enough how much against the
grain he finally confessed partition in the unity of God.
‘The first principle to be acknowledged in the Scriptures,’
he says, ‘is the Being of One God; but as the
same Scriptures speak of a Father, a Son, and a Holy
Ghost, what have we for it&mdash;<i>quid aliud restat</i>&mdash;but to
own three Persons in the Godhead? These, however,’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">494</span>
he proceeds in the usual orthodox fashion to say, and in
contradiction to the words first made use of, ‘imply no
plurality of persons, neither do they destroy the essential
unity of God; for where were Quaternity to be found
does the one God comprise in himself three properties&mdash;<i>ubi
autem quaternitas reperitur si unus Deus tres in se
proprietates contineat</i>?’<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> Where, indeed! But the
question is of <i>persons</i> not of properties; as in the
affair with Caroli it was of an Eternal Son not of an
Eternal Word.</p>

<p>In another place we find him using such language
as this: ‘The words of the Council of Nic&aelig;a are
these: God of God&mdash;a hard expression I admit, for
the removal of the ambiguity of which no better interpreter
can be found than Athanasius, who indited it&mdash;<i>Deum
a Deo&mdash;dura loquutio fateor, sed ad cujus tollendam
ambiguitatem nemo potest esse magis idoneus
interpres quam Athanasius qui eam dictavit</i>.’</p>

<p>Elsewhere, though we have omitted to note the
place, he declares that the Athanasian symbol was
never approved by any of the legitimate [i.e. Protestant]
Churches&mdash;<i>cujus symbolum nulla unquam legitima
ecclesia approb&acirc;sset</i>.’<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> Such writing is surely very
noteworthy. Calvin’s acknowledgment of a Trinity
is neither of his understanding nor his faith; it is enforced
merely and obviously in opposition to the reason
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_495">495</span>
he had from God for his guidance. But Michael
Servetus, whom he sent to a fiery death, not only does
not deny, but expressly, and oftener than once, avows
that he acknowledges a Trinity in the Essence of God.
He, too, found the words Father, Son, and Holy Ghost
in the Scriptures; and, as little disposed as Calvin to
gainsay a word they contain, he actually uses language
the simple sense of which is that precisely under which
Calvin seeks to shield himself; only he employs the
word <i>dispositions</i> instead of <i>properties</i>. Calvin, when
he attempts to reconcile the idea of a Trinity of persons
co-existing with an unity of Being, and does not use
language that contradicts itself, speaks no otherwise
than Servetus, and arrives in fine at the same interpretation
of the Trinitarian Dogma: the <i>persons</i> are
<i>dispositions</i> to the one, <i>properties</i> to the other!</p>

<p>After the most careful study of the writings of Servetus
we have been able to bestow, we have it forced
upon us that had Calvin been so minded he could from
them, more readily, and far more consistently, have
defended their author as a sincerely pious, though in his
opinion, a much mistaken man in his interpretation of
Christian doctrine, than prosecuted him as the enemy
of all religion, a monster, as he says, made up of mere
impieties and horrible blasphemies! But to the intolerant
bigot, engrossed by his own conceits and
dislikes, all Servetus’s confiding piety was hypocrisy,
his touching prayers mockery, and his eloquence as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">496</span>
becoming in him as a coat of mail to a hog&mdash;‘<i>qu’une
jaserame un Truie</i>’(!)</p>

<p>Nor can Calvin have credit given him for religious
zeal, as the principal, still less as the sole ground for
his prosecution of Servetus. He would condone the
Church of Berne for repudiating him who denied the
Trinitarian mystery, but could not forgive the Spaniard’s
intemperate and disrespectful style of address
to himself. In this lay the prime cause of offence to
the man, accustomed to have all the world bowing
down before him, who was always addressed as ‘<i>Monsieur</i>,’
not as ‘<i>Ma&icirc;tre</i>,’ like the rest of the clergy, and
whose appointments, however modest in our eyes,
equalled those of a dignitary of the Church in neighbouring
lands. One of Nicolas de la Fontaine’s counts
against the man he did not even know, but whom he
arraigned for life or death, is the objectionable language
indulged in towards his pastor; and we have Calvin’s
own words against himself when he says that Servetus’s
‘arrogance, not less than his impiety, led to his
destruction;’ whilst he elsewhere owns, that ‘had
Servetus but been possessed of even a show of modesty
he would not have pursued him so determinedly on
the capital charge.’</p>

<p>By way of conclusion here, let us observe that
Calvin’s fundamental principle of Election by the
Grace of God ought to have stayed his hand from all
persecution on religious grounds. He is constantly
spoken of as a man possessed of a peculiarly logical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_497">497</span>
mind. But if it be by the eternal decrees of God that
some are ordained to salvation and some to perdition,
how should Servetus or anyone else come between
God and his purposes? How should the Elect be
prejudiced, or the Reprobate made worse by the act
of man?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_498">498</span></p>

<h2 id="BOOK_II_CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<p class="center">CALVIN DEFENDS HIMSELF.</p>

<p>Dissatisfaction with what had been done appears to
have become general immediately after the execution
of Servetus. It extended beyond the walls of the
Council chamber and found wider expression than in
the arrest of proceedings against Geroult. Ballads
and pasquinades, little complimentary to Calvin and
his party, circulated freely, and were all the more persistently
spread in private if none dared to utter them
in public or sing them in the streets. Calvin himself
acknowledges that fear alone of consequences repressed
for a time any open expression of abhorrence for the
death of Servetus. Certain it is, that before the year
was out, save among friends and obsequious followers,
the act in which he had taken the prominent part came
to be so unfavourably construed that he felt forced
to appear as his own apologist, and in justification
of his deed to proclaim his victim not only a heretic
because of theological dissidence, with which the
people of Geneva were familiar enough and not
always greatly scandalised, but to hold him up as
wholly without religious convictions himself, the open
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">499</span>
enemy of all religion in others, the conspirator against
the moral well-being of the world, and the conscience-stricken
craven in face of his impending fate!</p>

<p>To this task Calvin would seem to have been more
especially incited by Bullinger, who loses no opportunity
of showing himself hostile to Servetus; and even
thinks that ‘were Satan to come back from hell and
take to preaching for pastime, he would make use of
much the same language as Servetus the Spaniard.’<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a>
Writing to Calvin at this time, and thinking doubtless
of the growing unpopularity of his friend, Bullinger
says: ‘See to it, dear Calvin, that you give a good account
of Servetus and his end, so that all may have
the beast in horror&mdash;<i>ut omnes abhorreant a bestia</i>!’
To which Calvin replies: ‘If I have but a little leisure
I shall show what a monster he was.’<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a></p>

<p>Such were the inducements Calvin had for entering
on the apologetic defence of himself through denouncing
the errors, impugning the motives, and blackening the
fame of Servetus to which he now applied himself and
had ready for publication both in French and Latin
early in the year 1554, the title of the French book in
brief being ‘<i>D&eacute;claration pour maintenir la vraye Foy</i>;’
that of the Latin, ‘<i>Defensio Orthodox&aelig; Fidei de sacra
Trinitate contra errores Michaelis Serveti, &amp;c.</i>’<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">500</span></p>

<p>In his introduction Calvin informs the reader that
he had ‘not at first thought it necessary to come
forward with any formal refutation of the errors of
Servetus,’ the ponderous absurdity of his ravings appearing
so plainly that he imagined it would be like
winnowing the wind to do so, for there was really no
danger of anyone of sound mind and ordinary understanding
not being found superior to such follies. ‘But
better informed, knowing the poison to be deadly in its
kind, and having regard to the amount of stupidity and
confusion which God, to avenge Himself, inflicts on all
who despise his doctrine, I have felt myself compelled
as it were to take up the pen, and in exposing the errors
of the man to furnish grounds for better conclusions.
When Servetus and his like, indeed, presume to meddle
with the mysteries of religion, it is as if swine came
thrusting their snouts into a treasury of sacred things.
May God pay all with the wages they deserve whose
vicious proclivities lead them to burn after one novelty
or another, which they can no more resist than can the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_501">501</span>
man from scratching who has the itch!&mdash;<i>pas plus que
celui qui a la ratelle qui d&eacute;mange</i>.’</p>

<p>‘The punishment that befel Servetus,’ he continues,
‘is always ascribed to me. I am called a master in
cruelty, and shall now be said to mangle with my pen
the dead body of the man who came to his death at my
hands. And I will not deny that it was at my instance
he was arrested, that the prosecutor was set on by me,
or that it was by me that the articles of inculpation were
drawn up. But all the world knows that since he was
convicted of his heresies I never moved to have him
punished by death. There needs no more than simple
denial from me to rebut the calumnies of the malevolent,
the brainless, the frivolous, the fools, or the dissolute.’</p>

<p>There is much in what precedes to challenge comment,
and the language, self-condemnatory of the writer
in one respect, if not purposely meant to mislead, is
yet greatly calculated to do so in another. If Servetus’
teaching was such ponderous folly that it could by no
possibility have any influence in the world, why did Calvin
proceed against him from the first on the capital
charge? It is God, too, who inflicts such stupidity on
mankind as makes the intervention of John Calvin
necessary to set things right; and the denial and vituperative
epithets at the end of the paragraph last quoted
do not cover an obvious intention on his part to have
the reader conclude that he had had nothing to do with
the doom which befel the Spaniard. But Calvin knew
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">502</span>
that by the law of Geneva the convicted heretic must
die; and he had written to his friend Farel on August
20, within a week of the arrest, that he hoped the sentence
<i>would be capital at the least</i>&mdash;<i>spero capitale saltem
judicium fore</i>. All the favour Calvin ever asked for
Servetus was that he might die by the sword instead
of by brimstone and slow fire. He does not say so
much indeed, but it almost looks as if he would have
the world believe that he had moved to save the man’s
life! We have his own acknowledgment, however,
of the active part he took in the prosecution of Servetus
at Geneva, and his expressed hope of what the sentence
should be. This much he could not deny; the facts of
the case put it out of his power. But he always shirked
complicity with all that happened at Vienne. There
there was underhand dealing and betrayal of trust,
and he would fain have the world believe that he had
had nothing to do with the ugly business. But here,
too, everything we know, is against him, and all he says
by way of freeing himself from the charge of having
denounced Servetus to the authorities of Lyons seems
but to strengthen the conclusion that he did. Calvin
was an able man undoubtedly, but he was not a cunning
man, and often lets his pen give expression to thoughts
of things gone by, which he would not have suffered to
appear had he been more artful.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In one of his epistles he says, ‘Nothing less is said of me
than that I might as well have thrown Servetus amid a pack
of wild beasts as into the hands of the professed enemies of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_503">503</span>
the Church of Christ; for I have the credit given me of
having caused him to be arrested at Vienne. But why such
sudden familiarity between me and the satellites of the
Pope? Is it to be believed that confidential letters could
have passed between parties who had as little in common as
Christ and Belial? Yet why many words to refute that
which simple denial from me suffices to answer! Four years
have now passed since Servetus himself spread this report.
I only ask why, if he had been denounced by me, as said, he
was thereafter suffered to remain unmolested for the space of
three whole years? It must either be allowed that the crime
I am charged withal is a pure invention, or that my denunciation
did him no harm with the Papists.’</p></blockquote>

<p>True, and answers to all he says are not far to
seek. Why the familiarity with the satellites of the
Pope? That he might be avenged through them on
one whom he regarded at once as a dangerous heretic
and a personal enemy. How should confidential letters
have passed between parties who had so little in common
as himself and the Roman Catholics of Lyons?
Because he would have had them the instruments of
his vengeance. If denounced by him, as said, how
did Servetus remain unmolested for three whole years?
Because denunciation for heresy of one who lived in
good repute with his friends as a true son of the
Church, by another standing in the very foremost
ranks of heresy, was taken no notice of by Cardinal
Tournon and his advisers.&mdash;All that Calvin says now
seems but to demonstrate the truth of what we have
from Bolsec, and may possibly have been the ground
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_504">504</span>
of the warning against the over free expression of his
opinions which Servetus is said to have received long
before the <i>denouement</i> that followed the printing of the
‘Christianismi Restitutio.’ Calvin continues:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘Would that the errors of Servetus might have been
buried with him; but as his ashes continue to spread a
pestiferous stench I go on to expose his heresies, a task
delayed till now through no fear of measuring myself with
one like him, for I have coped with adversaries much more
redoubtable than he, but because I had other work in hand
of more importance as I believed. He, however, who contends
that it is unjust to punish heretics and blasphemers,
I say, becomes their deliberate associate. You tell me of the
authority of man; but we have the word of God and his
eternal laws for the government of his Church. Not in vain
has He commanded us to suppress every human affection for
the sake of religion. And wherefore such severity, if it be
not for this, that we are to prefer God’s honour to mere
human reason.’</p></blockquote>

<p>But the St. Bartholomew and all the nameless
horrors that have been perpetrated in the name of
religion and to uphold what is called the honour of
God, are the logical outcome of principles that lead to
such language. Calvin’s treatment of Servetus was in
truth nothing less than a direct encouragement to the
Roman Catholics of France to persevere in their
atrocities towards the Protestants. Geneva, which had
been looked on as the bulwark of independent
thought and of freedom to worship God according to
conscience came to be regarded as the seat of another
Inquisition. All and sundry who pretended to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_505">505</span>
think for themselves, and who did not include Election
and Predestination in their creed, must be silent. Did
they speak or say a word against the rules and regulations
of the modern propounder of the doctrine of
God’s partiality, they were mercilessly hunted down,
fined, imprisoned, scourged on the back, branded on
the cheek, banished from their homes, or, as in the
case of Servetus, put to death; even as the moving
cause of all these atrocities would himself have been
dealt with in France had he there avowed what were
there styled the heretical opinions he entertained&mdash;the
damnable doctrines he taught. Persecution which
follows necessarily from the principles on which the
Church of Rome is founded, could not be entered on
by the Reformed Churches without a total abnegation
of those to which they owe their existence.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a></p>

<p>But it is not with Servetus’s doctrines alone that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_506">506</span>
Calvin occupies himself in his ‘Declaration’ and ‘Defence.’
He must further darken the fame of the man
whom he slew, for the consistency and fortitude he displayed
when confronted with death, as we have seen
him essaying to detract from the purity and probity
of his life on his trial. ‘Servetus,’ says Calvin, ‘was
only bold when he had no fear of punishment before
him; but so overwhelmed was he in face of his impending
fate, that he was lost to all and everything
about him. Praying with the people he had said
were Godless, he yet prayed as if he had been in the
midst of the Church of God, and thereby showed that
his opinions were nothing to him! Giving no sign of
regret or repentance, saying never a word in vindication
of his doctrines, what, I ask you, is to be thought
of the man who, at such a time, and with full liberty to
speak, made no confession one way or another, any
more than if he had been a stock or a stone? He had
no fear of having his tongue torn out; he was not forbidden
to say what he liked; and though at last he
declined to call on Jesus as the eternal Son of God
(Calvin omits to say that he called devoutly with his
latest breath on Jesus as Son of the eternal God),
inasmuch as he made no declaration of his faith, who
shall say that this man died a martyr’s death?’ ‘Theological
hatred,’ says a late esteemed writer,<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> ‘never
inspired words more atrociously cruel and unjust than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_507">507</span>
these of Calvin;’ and we do not hesitate to indorse
the dictum. Calvin’s challenge of Servetus’s fortitude
in the face of death is most unjust. Servetus went
bravely to his death; though to him, in the vigour of
life, and possessed of all his powers,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With thoughts that wandered through Eternity,<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>life assuredly was sweet; and to lose it not only for no
crime, but for the avowal of what he believed to be holy
truth, was hard indeed. To Servetus existence was
not summed up in ministering to mere material wants
and putting off and on at eve and morn; it meant <i>doing</i>
in the knowable, <i>speculating</i> in that which transcends
the known, furthering knowledge of the world we live
in, striving after congruous conceptions of the Almighty
Cause of the good, and ministering to the ill that befals&mdash;a
truly noble life!</p>

<p>But Calvin could no more forgive Servetus his
constancy and consistency than he could endure his
theological divergences and his personal insults.
‘Could we but have had a retractation from Servetus
as we had from Gentilis!’ exclaims he, upon another
occasion. Strange! that men in whom the religious
sense is strong should still be blind to the truth that if
there be sincerity in the world, they, too, who feel
strongly though divergently on religion, must be as
truly religious and sincere as themselves; and that
convictions in the sphere of faith&mdash;those garments of
the soul&mdash;cannot be put off and on at pleasure, like the
garments of the body!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_508">508</span></p>

<p>It were needless to say that Calvin’s refutation, or
shall we say <i>condemnation</i> of Servetus, is full and complete,
if it be not at all times of the complexion which
unimpassioned weighing of the argument, considerate
appreciation of the purpose, and truthful interpretation
of the language of an opponent would have secured.
Both of the forms in which the book appeared were
well received by the public; the ‘<i>D&eacute;claration pour
Maintenir la Vraye Foy</i>’ having been extensively read
by those who were not masters of the Latin; the
‘<i>Fidelis expositio Errorum</i>’ by those who were.
Bullinger, it appears from what Calvin says, must formerly
have urged him on to severity; and, as we have
just seen, now shows himself anxious to have his friend
appear in defence of what had been done. Writing
immediately after the publication of the book, he congratulates
the writer on his work; the only fault he has
to find with it being the terseness of the style, which
leads at times to obscurity, and its brevity. Calvin, in
reply, excuses himself for the conciseness of his language
and the modest length of his work. But his
letter, in so far as it relates to our subject, is too important
not to have a place in our narrative.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Your last letter, Calvin says, was duly delivered by our
excellent brother Tho. Jonerus. I was from home at the time,
so that I could not show him the hospitality he deserved, but
it so fell out that the Lord in my absence provided for him in
a way that could not have been bettered.... I have
always feared that in my book my conciseness may have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_509">509</span>
occasioned some obscurity; but I could not well guard against
it. I may say, indeed, that with the end I had in view other
motives led me to the brevity you speak of. In writing at
all it was not only my principal but my sole object to expose
the detestable errors of Servetus. It seemed to me that the
subjects handled were best discussed in the plainest terms,
and that the impious errors of the man should not be overlaid
by any lengthy or ornate writing of mine. I, therefore,
say nothing more of the severity of the style on which you
animadvert. I have, indeed, taken every possible pains to
show the common reader how without much trouble the
thorny subtleties of Servetus may be exposed and refuted. I
am not blind to the fact, however, that though I am wont to
be concise in my writings I have felt myself more bound to
brevity here than usual. But so it be only allowed that the
sound doctrine has been defended by me in sincerity of faith
and with understanding, this is of far more moment than any
regrets I may feel for having been forced on the task. You,
however, for the love you bear me, and led by the candour
and equity of your nature, will judge me favourably in what I
have done. Others may construe me more harshly; say I
am a master in severity and cruelty, and that with my pen I
lacerate the body of the man who came to his death through
me. Some, too, there are, not otherwise evilly disposed, who
say that the world is silent as to what was done, and that no
attempt is made to refute my argument on the punishment of
heresy, through fear of my displeasure. But it is well that I
have you for the associate of my fault, if, indeed, there be any
fault; for you were my authority and instigator. Look to it,
therefore, that you gird yourself for the fight....</p>

<p class="author">

<p>Geneva, November 3, 1554.</p></blockquote>

<p>This interesting letter<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> seems to show that Calvin
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_510">510</span>
had already conceived misgivings of his conduct in the
affair of Servetus. When John Calvin condescends to
seek support beyond himself, and to charge a friend
with having egged him on to the deed whose memory
seems now to rankle in his mind, he must have felt less
sure than was his wont that all he did was well done</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>

<p>Self-reliant as he was, and ready else to take on himself
the responsibility of his acts, we yet see that he,
the strong man among the strong, now felt the want
not only of sympathy and approval, but of some one
to share the ‘fault, if fault there were,’ in a relentless
pursuit and terrible deed. When he would thus associate
Bullinger with himself in his pitiless persecution of
the ill-starred Servetus, Calvin must refer to the letter
he had had from the Z&uuml;rich pastor of September 14,
as well as to the one in which the reply of the Church
of Z&uuml;rich to the Council of Geneva is couched&mdash;reply
of which there need be no question Bullinger was the
writer. Of all the ministers of the Swiss Churches
Calvin, we believe, had the highest respect for Bullinger,
who, as he did not always truckle to him, fell out
of favour at times, but only to come back anon with
heartier consideration than before.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_511">511</span></p>

<p>Melanchthon, too, whom we have found taking
more notice of the work on Trinitarian Error than any
of the other Reformers, would seem to have gone
on to the end of his life increasing in hostility to its
author. He, indeed, shows little of the mildness with
which he is commonly credited whenever in later years
the name of Servetus meets him. Writing to Calvin
in October 1554, a year consequently after the death
of Servetus, and when he had probably read the
‘Apologia de Mysterio Trinitatis,’ addressed to him,
and printed at the end of the ‘Christianismi Restitutio,’
Melanchthon congratulates the Reformer ‘for all he
had done in bringing so dangerous a heretic to justice.’
‘I have read your able refutation of the horrible blasphemies
of the Spaniard; and for the conclusion attained
give thanks to the Son of God who was umpire
in your contest. The Church, too, both of the day
and of the future, owes you thanks, and will surely
prove itself grateful.’<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a></p>

<p>Calvin’s more intimate friends and partisans, with
few exceptions, approved of his zeal in vindicating the
honour of God, as they said, and treading out, as they
imagined, the threatening spark of heresy kindled by
Servetus. Later admirers and adherents, again, unable
to condone his deed, attempt to find, and flatter themselves
that they do find, excuse for him in the ruder
and sterner temper of the times in which he lived.
But we own, regretfully, that with all we know, we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_512">512</span>
cannot follow them in this. Calvin was not only a man
of the highest intelligence, he was also possessed of a
carefully cultivated mind. An admirable scholar, deeply
read in the humanities, and familiar with history, he
had in earlier life, and in face of the persecution for
conscience’ sake beginning under Francis I., manfully
raised his voice for toleration. He had even gone out
of his way, as we have seen, and spent his money in
republishing Seneca’s ‘Treatise on Clemency,’ with
added comments of his own, by way of warning, beyond
question, to his sovereign against the fatal course on
which he saw him entering.</p>

<p>Addressing another among the monarchs of the
earth in a later work,<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> he says: ‘Wisdom is driven from
among us, and the holy harmony of Christ’s kingdom,
that makes lambs of wolves and turns spears into
pruning-hooks, is compromised when violence is impressed
into the service of religion.’ And yet again
we have him using words like these: ‘Although we
are not to be on familiar terms with persons excommunicated
by the Church for infractions of discipline, we
are still to strive by clemency and our prayers to bring
them into accord with its teaching. Nor, indeed, are
such as these only to be so entreated; but Turks, Saracens,
and others, positive enemies of the true religion,
also. Drowning, beheading, and burning are far from
being the proper means of bringing them and their like
to proper views.’<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_513">513</span></p>

<p>Calvin had, therefore, got beyond his age and its
spirit of intolerance; and, having turned his back on
the Church of Rome, no shelter can be found for him
in an appeal to its sanguinary principles and practice.
Calvin, in a word, is inexcusable for refusing to Servetus
the liberty he arrogated for himself, and for
turning the city that sheltered him into a shambles for
the man of whom religiousness alone had made an
enemy, and persecution had driven into his power.</p>

<p>Servetus, however, it is said, was a heretic, a blasphemer.
But what was Calvin in the eyes of those he
had forsaken? The most egregious of heretics, whose
teaching had led thousands from the faith of their
fathers, and imperilled their salvation; a traitor, too,
whose independent principles turned subjects into
rebels, and tended to make despotic rule by Priest and
King impossible. And this is true; for we are not to
overlook the fact that it is to Calvin, with however
little purpose on his part, that we mainly owe the large
amount of civil and religious liberty we now enjoy.</p>

<p>Of Calvin, more truly perhaps than of any man that
ever lived, may the dictum of the poet, where he says:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The evil that men do lives after them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The good is oft interred with their bones,<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>be held to be reversed. In Calvin’s case it was the ill
he did that died, the good that lived. With no respect
for civil liberty himself, and still less for religious liberty
beyond the pale of his own narrow confession of faith,
Calvin must nevertheless be thought of as the real
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_514">514</span>
herald of modern freedom. Holding ignorance to be
incompatible with the existence of a people at once
religious and free, Calvin had the school-house built beside
the church, and brought education within the reach
of all. Nor did he overlook the higher culture. He
restored the College of Geneva, founded half a century
before by a pious and liberal citizen, but utterly neglected
in Roman Catholic times; and as a complement
to the University he founded the Academy. Forbidden
to set foot on the land of his birth, he was nevertheless
the genius of its religious growth, and in company with
this, of its aspirations after freedom. But for the fickleness
and falseness of its princes, France might have had
reformed Christianity for her faith; and with the intelligence,
morality, and true piety of her Huguenot sons
in possession of their homes, might possibly have been
spared her Grand Monarques and despotism, her
Revolutions, her Buonapartes, and her wars that have
drenched the soil of Europe in blood ever since Henry
of Navarre proved untrue to himself and Liberty.
But Scottish Presbyterianism and English Puritanism
and Nonconformity in its multifarious, sturdy, self-sufficing
forms, and 1688, were each and all the legitimate
outcome of a system which told the world that
there was no such thing in the law of God as divine
right to govern wrongly; and in asserting free-thought
for itself in matters of opinion, by indefeasible logic
gave a title to all to think freely.</p>

<p>There can be little question, in fact, that Calvinism,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_515">515</span>
or some modification of its essential principles, is the
form of religious faith that has been professed in the
modern world by the most intelligent, moral, industrious,
and freest of mankind. If Calvinism, however,
tend to make men more manly and more fit for freedom,
it has also a certain hardening influence on the
heart, disposing to severity. Yet has not even this been
without its compensating good; for when Calvin&mdash;impersonation
of relentless rigour&mdash;sent the pious Servetus
to the flames, it may be said that the knell of
intolerance began to toll. Persistence in consigning
dissidents from the religious dogmas of the day to
death was made henceforth impossible, and persecution
on religious grounds to any minor issue has come by
degrees to be seen not only as indefensible in principle,
but immoral in fact; for it strikes at the root of the
very noblest elements in the constitution of humanity&mdash;Conscience
and Loyalty to Truth.</p>

<p>But Calvinism has had its day. The free inquiry
of which it sprang has slowly, yet surely, carried all
save its wilfully blind or ignorant adherents beyond
the pale of their old beliefs. More than a century ago
the Church of Geneva broke not only with its Confession
of Faith as formulated by its founder, but with
confessions of faith of every complexion; so that one
of its leaders, on occasion of the late tercentenary
commemoration of the death of the Reformer, could
say: <i>Nous ne sommes plus Calvinistes selon Calvin</i>.
Nor has the defection of the Swiss been singular; they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_516">516</span>
have been followed more or less closely by the Dutch,
the Germans, the more advanced of the Protestant
Church of France, and finally and at length by the
Scotch. In the land of Knox, the very stronghold
of Judaic Christianity as defined by Calvin and his
great disciple, open rebellion has broken out against
the narrowness of the Creed and Catechism of the
Westminster Assembly of Divines so obsequiously
followed until now; prelude, doubtless, to further
disruption and greater change than have yet been
seen; for modern criticism and exegesis, and ever
advancing science, proclaim arrest at any grade in
the Religious Idea yet attained by the Churches to be
impossible.

<h2 id="BOOK_II_CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<p class="center">CALVIN’S DEFENCE IS ATTACKED.</p>

<p>Even whilst the trial was proceeding, we have seen
that Calvin was not without opposition in his pursuit
of Servetus. Amied Perrin, his great political rival,
had striven for mercy or a minor punishment to the
last; and he was not without followers in the Council.
But they were outnumbered and out-voted there, so
that the light of the ‘blessed quality that is not
strained’ was quenched. Outside the circle of the
governing body also, more than one voice was raised
against the manifest aim of Calvin to have his theological
opponent capitally convicted. But it was by
persons of inferior note. David Bruck, among others,
a man of talent and quondam minister of a congregation
of Anabaptists in the North, now living privately
and respected under the name of David Joris at
Berne, went so far as to speak of Servetus as a pious
man, and to declare that if all who differed from others
in their religious views were to be put to death, the
world would be turned into one sea of blood.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a></p>

<p>But the writer who received most notice from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_518">518</span>
Calvin and his friends was he who appeared under
the assumed name of Martin Bellius. Taking as his
text the 29th verse of the 4th chapter of Paul’s Epistle
to the Galatians: ‘As then he that was born of the flesh
persecuted him that was born of the Spirit, even so is
it now,’ Bell proceeded to show that persecution to
death on religious grounds, though it might be Judaism
was not Christianity, and that many learned men and
eminent doctors of the Church, both of older and more
modern times, had been emphatic in condemnation of
all intolerance in the sphere of religion. Bell’s book,
small in bulk but weighty in argument, was felt as
a home-thrust by the Reformer of Geneva, his own
words in favour of toleration among others being
quoted against him. It is often spoken of at the time
as the Farrago&mdash;Calvin himself so designates it when
sending a copy of it to his friend Bullinger. But
neither Calvin nor his friends liked the book; and
it is in depreciation of its real significance that it is
spoken of as a medley.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a></p>

<p>Premising an Introduction, addressed to Frederick,
the reigning Duke of W&uuml;rtemberg, in which the writer
sets forth his own views, he asks the Duke whether
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_519">519</span>
he should think a subject of his deserving of death
who, avowing belief in God and his earnest desire to
live in conformity with the precepts of Scripture, should
say that he did not think baptism was properly performed
on an infant eight days old; but was of opinion
that the rite should be deferred until years of discretion
had been attained and the recipient could give a reason
for the faith that was in him? Did the subject think
further that if he were required by law to baptize infants
he was running counter to Christ’s ordinance,
and felt that he was doing violence to his conscience,
Bell asks the Duke again, ‘Did he think, if Christ were
present as Judge, that He would order the man who so
delivered himself to be put to death?’ Replying to
his question himself, he says: ‘I venture to believe
that He would not.’</p>

<p>Our author then proceeds to quote from the works
of many writers, who maintain that the punishment of
heretics is no part of the civil magistrate’s duty; from
Erasmus, who declares that God, the Great Father of
the human family, will not have heretics, even h&aelig;resiarchs,
put to death, but tolerated in view of their possible
amendment. ‘When I think how reprehensible are
heresy and schism,’ says the great scholar, ‘I am scarce
disposed to condemn the laws against them; but when
I call to mind the gentleness wherewith Christ led his
disciples, I shrink from the instances I see of men sent
to prison and the stake on the ground of their disagreement
with scholastic dogmas.’ From Aug. Eleutherius,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_520">520</span>
who opines that ‘they are not always truly heretics
whom the vulgar so designate.’ From Lactantius, who
says ‘Force and violence are out of place in matters
of faith; for religion cannot be forced on mankind;
words not stripes are here the proper instruments of
persuasion.’ From Augustin, who goes so far as to
say that ‘for the sake of peace even dogs are to be
tolerated in the Church. The Catholic servants of
God are not to stain themselves with the blood of their
enemies, but to be examples of patience and forbearance.
It is no business of theirs to gather the tares
for burning before the harvest is ready; they who err
are men, and it is man’s part to bear with the erring;
the tares do no real harm to the wheat; and if the
erring be not cured here, they do not escape punishment
hereafter.’</p>

<p>There is much besides from others, which we spare
the reader; but we have to show that clemency for
theological divergence was no novelty in the age of
Calvin; and no one will imagine for a moment that
he had forgotten what he had written himself, or was
ignorant of a word that had ever been said on the subject
by others.</p>

<p>Martin Bell’s tractate was so eagerly seized upon by
the public, and proved so influential in turning the tide
of self-gratulation on which Calvin had been floating
somewhat at his ease since the appearance of his ‘Declaration’
and ‘Defence,’ that it was thought necessary
to find an antidote to the bane of reason and mercy,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_521">521</span>
so modestly but so convincingly presented in its pages.
Calvin would probably have felt himself constrained to
take the field again, and, ‘confronting Bell with self-comparisons,’
to answer him ‘point against point’ in
person, had he not had his friend De Beza at hand to take
his place. Engaged at the moment with his Commentary
on Genesis, Calvin felt little disposed to interrupt
his work by entering anew on an old theme, though
ever ready to gird himself for the fight on one with
novelty to recommend it. The task of meeting Martin
Bell he therefore delegated to De Beza, who appeared
anon in a volume three or four times the size of the
Farrago in answer to its plea for latitude in the interpretation
of the Scriptures, and against the infliction of
death for the religious divergence called heresy in
any or all of the multifarious forms in which it shows
itself.</p>

<p>With the terrible text of the Jewish Bible, ‘If thy
brother, thy son, the wife of thy bosom, or the friend
that is as thine own soul, entice thee, saying, Let us go
and serve other Gods; thou shalt not consent to him,
neither shall thine eye have pity on him, neither shalt
thou spare him, but thou shalt surely kill him, thy
hand shall be first upon him to put him to death,’ &amp;c.
(Deut. xiii. 6 and seq.), and much besides, akin to this,
assumed as the command of God, Beza had no very difficult
task before him in persuading himself and his party
that they had abidden by the Law in all that had been
done; satisfied as they were besides that those who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_522">522</span>
gainsaid them were the enemies of God and man when
they presumed to defend doctrines dishonouring, it
was said, to the Supreme and destructive of the peace
of the world.&mdash;God, in a word, was with them; the
Devil and corrupt humanity on the side of their opponents,
and there an end.</p>

<p>We do not observe, however, that Beza’s reply,
though very ably conceived, and written with the skill
of the practised controversialist, had any great influence.
It was not reprinted in a separate form, and
although translated into Dutch, seems to have been
little read beyond the circle of Calvin’s friends and
followers. Short as was the time that had elapsed
since Servetus perished, the apologists of the man who
sent him to his death were already in the rear of
public opinion on the subject. The jurisdiction of the
magistrate had come to be seen ever more and more
clearly to lie within the sphere of <span class="smcap">Act</span>, and to have
nothing to do with <span class="smcap">Opinion</span>.</p>

<p>A conclusion so wholesome as this was greatly
strengthened by the appearance of another book in immediate
reply to Calvin’s ‘Declaration’ and ‘Defence,’
entitled: ‘Contra Libellum Calvini, &amp;c. against Calvin’s
book, in which he strives to show that heretics are
to be dealt with capitally.’<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> This is the little work
that is often referred to as ‘a Dialogue between Calvin
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_523">523</span>
and Vaticanus,’ ‘Dialogus inter Calvinum et Vaticanum.’
In the Preface to the copy I have used, the
work is ascribed to Sebastian Castellio, and several
short papers from this distinguished scholar are appended
to the text; but he most certainly was not
its author. An old and determined opponent of
Calvin, whose doctrine of Predestination and Election
he had had the hardihood, in a special pamphlet,
to criticise and controvert, Castellio had aroused the
ire of Calvin; and it was on this ground probably
that he had the credit given him of having written
the ‘Dialogus.’ Calvin’s displeasure, we know, never
meant anything less than personal hate and persecution,
so that, in his answer to what he styles the ‘calumnies’
of Castellio, after the preliminary abuse in which he
calls him ‘faithless and unmannered,’ he says, ‘They
who do not know thee to be shameless and a deceiver,
do not know thee aright. I should like to be informed
how thou wilt prove that I am cruel? By throwing
the death of thy master Servetus in my face, perhaps;
and saying, that with my pen I mangle the body of
the man who came to his death through me; but did
I not entreat for him? His judges will bear me out
in this; two of whom, at least, were his particular
patrons.’<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a></p>

<p>In the passage just quoted, Calvin seems to reply
to what Vaticanus has said in his introduction to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_524">524</span>
book that engages us, viz., that Servetus was the first
who had been put to death at Geneva on grounds of
religion, and that it was done at the instance and on
the authority of Calvin&mdash;‘<i>impulsore et authore Calvino</i>.’
Vaticanus continues: ‘Calvin will perhaps say, as is his
wont, that I am a disciple of Servetus. But let not
this frighten anyone. I am no defender of the doctrines
of Servetus, but I shall so expose the false doctrines
of Calvin, that every one shall see as plain as
noonday that he thirsted for blood. I shall not deal
with him, however, as he dealt with Servetus, whom
he proceeded to tear in pieces with his pen, after having
burned him and his books. I do not, therefore, discuss
the Trinity, Baptism, &amp;c., seeing that I have not the
books of Servetus, whence I might learn what he
says on these subjects, Calvin having taken such pains
to have them burned&mdash;<i>quippe combustos diligentia Calvini</i>.
I shall not burn the books of Calvin; their
author is alive, and his books may be had both in
French and Latin, so that every one may see whether
I falsify aught he writes. But Servetus was a
blasphemer of God, says Calvin. The man himself,
however, believed that he honoured God, and persuaded
himself that he glorified God in his death.
But the persuasion is false, says Calvin. Be it so;
yet Servetus himself was not false; had he been so,
he would assuredly have saved his life; he therefore
died for his opinions.’</p>

<p>Without defending the views of Servetus we thus
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_525">525</span>
see Vaticanus asserting the courage and consistency of
the victim which had been unjustly called in question
by Calvin.</p>

<p>Coming to the burden of the book we find as many
as 150 passages from Calvin’s ‘Defensio orthodox&aelig;
fidei’ commented and controverted, and in addition, four
from the reply of Z&uuml;rich to the Council of Geneva.</p>

<p>By much the most complete and able of the works
against Calvin and those who would have heretics
punished by being put to death, is that of Minus Celsus
of Sienna.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> A fugitive from his native country to escape
arrest and punishment for having forsaken Popery,
Minus Celsus found safety at length after passing
through many perils in Switzerland. ‘Escaped from
the hands of Antichrist, as he says, and safe amid the
Rhetian Alps,’ he was not a little scandalised to find
nothing of the unity of doctrine among the Reformed
Churches he had been led to expect before leaving his
native country. ‘They held together as one, indeed, in
hate of the Pope, calling him Antichrist and looking on
the Mass as idolatry, but they differed on innumerable
other points among themselves, and not only persecuted
but went the length of putting each other to death, and
this in no such primitive way as by stoning, in old
Hebrew fashion, but by roasting the living man with a
slow fire, <i>vivum lento igne torrendo</i>&mdash;punishment more
horrible than Scythian or Cannibal ever contrived.’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_526">526</span></p>

<p>Celsus had heard of the execution of Servetus at
Geneva, and been assured by some who were present,
persons worthy of all trust, that the constancy of the
sufferer was such that many of the spectators, finding
it impossible to imagine anything of the kind endured
without the immediate support of God, instead of feeling
horror for a blasphemer rightfully put to death, were
led to look on him as a martyr to the cause of truth,
and so made shipwreck of the faith in which they had
hitherto lived.</p>

<p>This led Celsus to think of the treatise he had
formerly written in his native language on the proper
way of dealing with heresy, and turning it into Latin
he resolved to have it printed. He did not live, however,
to carry out his purpose; his book was only published
some years after his death by a friend who gives
no more than the initials of his name, J. F. D., but adds
M.D., whereby we learn that he was a physician.</p>

<p>‘No man,’ says Mosheim,<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> ‘can write more amiably
or controvert more gently than this Minus Celsus. He
never uses a word that is either bitter or insulting. His
principal opponents are Calvin and Beza, of course, but
he does not name them specially when he controverts
their conclusions, although he proclaims his horror of
all violence in matters of faith. He does, indeed, speak
of Calvin once by name, but it is with mingled commendation
and sorrow that ‘one who had deserved so
well of the Church on many counts, and who thought
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_527">527</span>
in earlier years that religion was not to be furthered by
severity or violence, should have finally fallen away
from his better persuasion. Why he changed, I know
not: God knows.’ Calvin did not live to see this
excellent work of the Siennese Celsus. Although
written in his lifetime, the great Reformer died twenty
years before it saw the light. How it would have
affected him we can only say with our pious Celsus,
God knows!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_528">528</span></p>

<h2 id="BOOK_II_CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<p class="center">CALVIN’S BIOGRAPHERS AND APOLOGISTS.</p>

<p>Among writers nearer our own time there are few who
openly and unreservedly uphold Calvin in his conduct
to Servetus, none who now advocate persecution unto
death for divergence in religious opinion. Even they
who hold the memory of Calvin in the highest honour
are driven, as we have seen, to find excuses for him in
his pursuit of the indiscreet but pious Spaniard. We
in these days do, indeed, believe that they who should
approve his deed would sin even as he did. Paul
Henry, the author of one of the latest lives we have of
Calvin, and his measureless partisan and apologist, even
with the moderate acquaintance he has with Servetus’
works, feels himself forced at times to pause in the
unmitigated condemnation of their author he is disposed
to indulge in. Like Farel, in contact with the
victim, telling the people that ‘after all the man
perhaps meant well;’ Henry says, that ‘from the
executed man, <i>der Gerichtete</i>, we hear certain echoes of
Christianity which sadden as they flow not from the
true faith. But his pyre still gleams portentous to the
world, and even when it burned it was a herald of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_529">529</span>
dawn of better days to come. Servetus, in his steadfast
protestation even unto death, became a true Reformer.
His fate has for ever impressed the Protestant (Henry
has the Evangelical) Church with hate of the besetting
sin of the Church of Rome, the crime of dealing with
religious error by inflicting death. It has even familiarised
the world with the thought that there is a still
higher development of the religious principle in man
than has yet found expression in either the Roman or
Reformed Churches, awaiting a coming time.’</p>

<p>This surely is noble writing. Nor does the apologist
pause here, but goes on to speak of him who to
Calvin and his age was a blasphemer of God, as being
really and in truth ‘a pious man.’ ‘Were an assembly
of Deputies from every Christian Church now to meet
on Champel,’ says Henry, ‘to take into consideration
all that is extant on the life and fate of Servetus, and to
review the facts in the light of the times to which they
refer, they would speak Calvin free from reproach and
pronounce him not guilty; of Servetus, on the other
hand, they would say, guilty, but with extenuating circumstances.’
We venture to believe, and trust we have
shown cause sufficient to warrant our conclusion, that
the sentence would be precisely the reverse. Calvin
would be found guilty, but with extenuating circumstances;
Servetus not guilty in all but the use of intemperate
and sometimes improper language.</p>

<p>Henry, to his honour, goes yet farther; he does not
approve of Calvin’s attempt to detract from the horror
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_530">530</span>
and pity we feel for Servetus’ fate, by charging him
with cowardice in the face of death. ‘Let us observe
in Servetus,’ says the biographer of Calvin, ‘those beautiful
traces of the true life which he showed at the last:
his regret for former tergiversations, his humility, his
constancy, his earnest prayer to God, and his forgiveness
of his enemies. Had he but had the truth in his
heart he would have died a true martyr; but he must
tremble in his death hour, for he had blasphemed the
Majesty of God.’ But Servetus did not tremble in his
death hour, he never blasphemed the Majesty of God,
and he died in charity with all men, even with him who
had brought him to his untimely end, and who ten
years after the death of his victim had no better title
for him than <i>Chien et meschant Garnement</i>,&mdash;dog and
wicked scoundrel!</p>

<p>Mosheim, to whom we owe the gathering and preservation
of much that is interesting in connection with
Servetus, working in the middle of the bygone century,
and referring to what Calvin himself avows, viz., ‘that
he would not have persevered so resolutely on the
capital charge had Servetus been but modest and not
rushed madly on his fate,’ exclaims, ‘What an avowal!
Servetus, after all, must burn not because he had outraged
the word of God, and infected the world with
error, but because he had addressed John Calvin in
disrespectful language! Calvin’s avowal is truly a hard
knot for those to untie who hold that revenge had
nothing to do with the death of Servetus. For my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_531">531</span>
own part I am not bound to weigh all the grounds that
tell for or against the Reformer, and I am not, perhaps,
altogether impartial. I am minded, however, that they
are not wholly in the right who say that Calvin proceeded
against the unhappy Spaniard led on by hatred
and revenge alone; and I am not so certain that they
are in the wrong who think it was not mere religious
zeal which suggested and carried the tragedy to its
conclusion. What is man! The very best often serve
God and themselves when they fancy they are serving
God alone.’</p>

<p>With these words of the pious historian of the
Church we conclude; tempering the severer criticism
suggested by the facts as they present themselves, with
the more charitable construction of the ecclesiastic.

<p>The ‘Christianismi Restitutio’ of Michael Servetus is one
of the rarest books in the world. Of the thousand copies
known to have been printed, two only are now known to survive;
one of these being among the treasures of the National
Library of Paris, the other among those of the Imperial and
Royal Library of Vienna. The history of both of these
copies, curiously enough, is complete from rather a remote
date, and it is somewhat provoking to know that both of them
were once in this country; but bigotry sent the one, and want
of religious sympathy, presumably, suffered the other to leave
our shores. The Paris copy certainly belonged to Dr. Richard
Mead, the distinguished physician and medallist, who lived in
the reign of Queen Anne, and is believed, before it came into
Mead’s possession, to have formed part of the Library of the
Landgrave of Kur-Hesse. How it got dissevered from this
is not known. It was probably stolen and brought to
England as to a sure market. Mead, liberal in politics and
presumably in religion also, appears to have felt so much interest
in Servetus’ work, not only by reason of the physiological
matter it contained, but because of the free spirit
of inquiry it breathed, that he was minded to have it reprinted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_536">536</span>
and made generally accessible. He had accordingly got half-way
with a new and handsome edition of the work in 4to.
form, so far back as the year 1723, when his purpose reached
the ears of Gibson, the then Bishop of London. Alarmed at
the idea of light being let in on the world that had not been
strained through the haze of Episcopalian orthodoxy, Gibson
addressed himself immediately to the Censor of the Press for
an injunction; and at his instance and order the impression,
so far as it had gone, was seized, adjudged heretical, and publicly
burned. A few copies of the reprint, however, must
have escaped the conflagration, of which one is now in the
Library of the London Medical Society. This I have had an
opportunity of examining, and find that there wanted but
little to have completed the most essential part of the work,
the last page printed being the first of the chapter entitled
‘De Justitia Regni Christi.’</p>

<p>Disgusted, we may imagine, with the bigotry of Bishop
Gibson and his abettors, and, it may be also, to secure his
copy of the original against the chance of seizure, confiscation,
and the fire, Doctor Mead exchanged it with M. de Boze,
Member of the French Academy of the Fine Arts, for a series
of medals, of which the Doctor was a known collector. The
library of M. de Boze being purchased after his death by
M. Boutin, late Intendant of Finance, and the President de
Cotte, in common, the Servetus fell to the share of De Cotte,
who sold it by-and-by at an exorbitant price, as said, to
M. Gaignat, who parted with it in turn for a still larger sum&mdash;as
much as 3,810 livres&mdash;to the Duc de la Vailli&egrave;re, the
greatest book collector of the age. On the death of De la
Vailli&egrave;re, and the dispersion of his magnificent library under
the hammer, in 1784, the ‘Rest. Christianismi,’ believed
at the time to be the only copy in existence, was secured for
the sum of 4,120 livres tournois for the Biblioth&egrave;que du Roi,
and it now remains one of the treasures of the great National
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_537">537</span>
Library of France. Much of the above information we gather
from the letter of M. l’Abb&eacute; Rive, Librarian to the Duc de la
Vailli&egrave;re, which is appended to the London edition of Dutens’
‘Recherches sur l’origine des D&eacute;couvertes attribu&eacute;es aux
Modernes,’ of the year 1766.</p>

<p>But this is not all, nor even the most interesting of all we
know about the Paris copy of the rare and remarkable book.
It has the name of ‘Germain Colladon’ on the title-page,
and the various passages on which Servetus was finally arraigned
and condemned are underscored. It can, therefore,
be no other than the copy which belonged to Colladon, the
barrister, who prosecuted Servetus at Geneva, and must have
been given him along with his brief by the attorney in the
case. But the attorney in the case of Servetus was John
Calvin; and we need not, therefore, doubt that the underlining
is by ‘l’impitoyable Calvin’&mdash;the ruthless Calvin, as M.
Flourens, who gives so much of the foregoing information
as we have not supplemented, characterises the Genevese
Reformer. The book shows what M. Flourens supposed to
be scorching in one part; and this he gratuitously accounts
for, by supposing that it is the copy which was to have been
burned along with its author, but was saved in some unaccountable
way. That copy, we may be well assured, was reduced
to ashes and scattered to the winds with those of its
hapless writer; and the presumed scorching, on the careful
examination it received from the Rev. Henry Tollin, turns out
to be the effect of damp. See Flourens’ ‘Histoire de la D&eacute;couverte
de la Circulation du Sang’ (Paris, 1854), 2nd Ed.
Ib. 1857, p. 154.</p>

<p>The Vienna exemplar of the ‘Christianismi Restitutio,’
again, when we first meet with a notice of it, belonged to
Markos Szent Ivanayi, a Transylvanian gentleman, resident
in London in the year 1665. Szent Ivanayi must, we presume,
have held Unitarian principles, and on his return to his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_538">538</span>
native country (in some districts of which Unitarianism is
the established or prevailing form of religion), he presented
his copy of the ‘Restitutio’ to the Congregation of Claudiopolis,
with which he was in communion; and they, at a later date,
by the hands of their superior, Stephen Agh, gave it, as the
most valuable thing they possessed, to Samuel, Count Teleki
de Izek, in acknowledgment of some act of favour from the
magnate. The Count, on his part, informed of the rarity of
the book, and rightly deeming that it was a gift such as a
subject might offer to his sovereign, presented it to the Emperor
Joseph the Second of Austria, by whom it was graciously
accepted and forthwith enshrined in the great Library of
Vienna. This copy of the ‘Restitutio’ is in better condition
than that of Paris&mdash;‘<i>pr&aelig;stat nitiore</i>,’ says Dr. de Murr, from
whom we have the foregoing information (De Murr, Chr. Th.,
M.D., ‘Adnotationes ad Bibliothecas Hallerianas, cum variis ad
Scripta Michaelis Serveti pertinentibus.’ 4to. Erlangen. 1805).</p>

<p>The authorities of Roman Catholic Austria, in 1790, more
liberally disposed than those of Protestant England in the
year of grace 1723, not only gave Dr. de Murr permission to
have a transcript made of the ‘Restitutio,’ but raised no objections
to his having his copy printed and published&mdash;a task
which he happily accomplished in 1791, ‘when the work appeared
anew, like a Phœnix from its ashes,’ as he says. The
reprint is, indeed, an exact counterpart of the original&mdash;line
for line, page for page being followed throughout; and as the
letter and paper have also been chosen to correspond as
nearly as possible with those of the prototype, it might have
been found difficult to distinguish between the one and the
other, were a third copy of the original ever to turn up, had
not Dr. de Murr put a mark upon his edition in the date of
its publication in extremely small figures&mdash;thus, <span class="x-small">1791</span>, at the
bottom of the last page. This, too, is a scarce book, so we
presume the edition was small.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_539">539</span></p>

<p>The earliest intimation the world at large received of
the existence of the ‘Christianismi Restitutio’ of Servetus
is to be found in Dr. Wm. Wotton’s ‘Reflections upon
Learning, Ancient and Modern’ (London, 1694); but his reference
is to nothing more than the passage bearing on the
way in which the blood from the right side of the heart
reaches the left. ‘The passage,’ says Wotton, ‘was communicated
to him by his friend Mr. Charles Barnard, a very
learned chirurgeon, who had had it transcribed for him by a
friend who copied it from Servetus’ book.’ Wotton, therefore,
had never seen the book himself. The copy from which the
passage was transcribed, in all likelihood was the one which
either was at the time or afterwards became the property of
Dr. Mead.</p>

<p>The next writer who refers to Servetus and his new views
of the pulmonic circulation is Dr. James Douglas, in his
‘Bibliographi&aelig; Anatomic&aelig; Specimen’ (London, 1715). But
neither had Douglas had an opportunity of examining the
work for himself. He does no more, in fact, than copy the
passage as given by Wotton.</p>

<p>The first member of the medical profession who gave any
account of Servetus’ physiological and psychological opinions
from an actual survey of the ‘Christianismi Restitutio,’ from
De Murr’s reprint, I believe to have been the late Dr. G.
Sigmond, an amiable man and accomplished scholar, who has
not been very long gone from among us. Sigmond, however,
has left us the result of his study in an appreciative Dissertation
in Latin and English; the introduction being in our
mother tongue, the text in the old language. Sigmond’s
work is entitled, ‘The Unnoticed Theories of Servetus; a
Dissertation addressed to the Medical Society of Stockholm.
8vo., London, 1826.’ To his great honour, Dr. Sigmond is
the first naturalist in these days who dared to see Michael
Servetus for what he was in truth: an accomplished and sincerely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_540">540</span>
pious man, but differing, to his sorrow, from both
Catholics and Protestants on some of the dogmatical assumptions
of their common creeds. The copy of the ‘Christianismi
Restitutio’ which Dr. Sigmond possessed, as said
above, was one of Dr. de Murr’s reprints, which had been
bequeathed to him by his friend Dr. James Sims, for many
years President of the Medical Society of London, a learned
man and lover of books, who believed it to be the original&mdash;a
belief not shared in by Sigmond, however, though he seems
to have known nothing of De Murr or his edition. This
copy, I think, must be the one which is now in the Library
of the British Museum, purchased in 1855, when Sigmond,
having lost the property he inherited from his father, seems
to have parted with his books, though he only died in 1873.</p>

<p>The question touching the Discovery of the Circulation of
the Blood, which will ever make Servetus an object of interest
to the medical profession, and had been in abeyance for
some considerable time past, has been brought under renewed
consideration of late, and busts and statues of several
learned and meritorious individuals have been inaugurated to
their memory as ‘discoverers of the circulation.’ In the porch
of the Instituto Antropologico of Madrid, for example, there
is a statue raised by Dr. Velasco to the memory of Michael
Servetus on this score, and we have but just heard of a bust set
up at Rome to Andrea C&aelig;salpino on the same ground. So distinguished
a physiologist as Dr. Valentin, moreover, has come
forward as an advocate of the claims of another and until now
unheard of discoverer of ‘the great physiological fact’ in anticipation
of Harvey. In his work entitled, ‘Versuch einer physiologischen
Pathologie des Herzens,’ Leipzig, 1866, Dr. Valentin
will be found saying that ‘it must now be conceded that
the pulmonary circulation was known to Servetus in 1553
[and he might have added, to Realdus Columbus in 1559],
and both this and the general systemic circulation to Ruini,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_541">541</span>
in 1598. That the pulmonic or lesser circulation&mdash;more properly
the passage or mode of transference of the blood from
the right to the left side of the heart&mdash;was known to Servetus
and to both Columbus and C&aelig;salpinus after him, there can
be no question; but I have assured myself, from a careful
study of the works of these distinguished individuals, that
none of them, least of all Ruini [Dell’ Anatomia del Cavallo,
Bologna, 1598], was fully or truly informed on the subject.
None of them apprehended the circulation of the blood as
did Harvey, and as we his followers do in the present day.</p>

<p>It were out of place did I pursue this subject further now;
but I hope to take it up anon in a new ‘Life of Harvey,’ long
meditated and all but completed, in which I shall show that
after all that had been done by those who went before him,
there still wanted the combining intellect, the inductive genius
of a Harvey to bring light out of darkness, order out of confusion,
and to lay the foundations, strong and sure, of our
modern physiology and rational medicine by proclaiming the
heart the moving power, and the arteries and veins the channels
of a continuous, general circulation of the blood.</p>

<h2>FOOTNOTES:</h2>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">1</a>
The Reverend Henry Tollin, Pastor of the French Protestant Church,
of Magdeburg, who has made the life and works of Servetus the particular
subject of his studies for many years, inclines to Tudela as the place, and
1511 as the year, of Servetus’s birth. See his ‘Servet’s Kindheit und Jugend’
in Kahnis’ <i>Zeitschrift f&uuml;r die Historische Theologie</i>. Jahrg. 1875, S. 545.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<i>Vide</i> Tollin: ‘Servet’s Kindheit und Jugend,’ in Kahnis’ <i>Zeitschrift
f&uuml;r die Historische Theologie</i>, 1875, S. 557. We have, however,
searched in vain for any evidence of Angleria’s presence in Saragossa at
any time, even as a casual resident. In his comprehensive and highly
entertaining work, the ‘Opus Epistolarum,’ we find letters of his from
Valladolid, Burgos, Vittoria, Madrid, and elsewhere, but not one from
Saragossa during the years covered by Servetus’s stay at the university,
according to Tollin.</p></div>

Tollin (Toulouser Studenten-Leben im Anfang des 16ten Jahrhunderts),
in Riehl’s <i>Historisches Taschenbuch von 1874</i>, S. 76, speaks as
if he had been present with Servetus at Toulouse; accompanied him over
the St. Michael’s bridge that spanned the Garonne; beheld the iron cage
suspended from its balk above the river for ducking heretics until they died;
looked on at the religious processions that filed incessantly through the
streets, etc.</p></div>

It is upon this passage, which we translate and interpret somewhat
differently from Tollin, that he grounds his statement of Servetus having
come into contact with Luther; a presumed meeting of which we fail to
find a trace in any contemporary document. See Tollin’s <i>Dr. M.

‘Der alte und der neue Glaube.’ All Theists agree in this: that
God is One, Changeless, and Eternal. But God without the Universe
would not be the same as God with the Universe; whence the conclusion
that God and the Universe can only be conceived of as correlatives. Seeing
the impossibility of dissevering Property from the Object in which it inheres,
the modern philosopher discards hypothetical agencies, under the name
of Spirits, of every kind; from the all-pervading force that keeps suns and
planets in their spheres, to such special agencies as those of brain and
nerve. Servetus, we have seen, had himself got the length of saying that
out of man there was no Holy Spirit.</p></div>

To Calvin God was no other than the Immanent Pantheistic principle
of Modern Philosophy: ‘Ubique diffusus, omnia sustinet, vegetat et
vivificat in cœlo et in terra&mdash;everywhere diffused, he gives life and growth
and continuance to all things in heaven and earth.’ These are his words.
He then goes on to say: ‘Fateor quidem pie hoc posse dici, modo a pio
animo proficiscatur, <i>Naturam esse Deum</i>&mdash;I own, indeed, that provided
we speak reverently it may be said that <i>Nature is God</i>.’ As this would
be a ‘hard and inappropriate expression,’ however, and as in using it
‘God is confounded with his works,’ he thinks it is objectionable.

At the end of the copy of the ‘De Trin. Error.,’ which Alw&ouml;rden
describes in his <i>Historia Michaelis Serveti</i>, now in the National Library
at Paris, there is a MS. <i>Refutation</i> of the views of the writer, which
Tollin ascribes with great show of probability to Bucer, who, as we know,
was personally acquainted with Servetus. Of this Refutation (Confutatio)
Tollin has given an extended analysis in <i>Riehm und K&ouml;stlin’s Theologische
Studien und Kritiken f&uuml;r 1875</i>, S. 711.</p></div>

Servetus’s <i>De Trinitatis Erroribus</i> is generally believed to be one
of the rare books, yet it is commonly enough met with in England. So
long ago as the year 1725, however, a copy bound with the <i>Dialogi</i> sold
for the large sum of between four and five hundred French livres. There
is a counterfeit edition published in Holland, and only to be distinguished
from the original by the paper being somewhat better and the type a
shade larger. The Book was never, in so far as we know, publicly condemned
and burned. It was translated into Dutch (4to. 1620) with the
epigraph: Prœft alle Dingen ende behout het gœde, 1 John iv.</p></div>

<i>Disceptatio Apologetica pro Astrologia.</i> I have searched the

That the one addressed to Fuchs once existed among us, however, is
certain; for its title is to be seen in the catalogue of Dr. Williams’s
Library (Grafton Street, University College); but unfortunately the
work is not now to be found&mdash;it had disappeared before the present
Librarian, Dr. Hunter, came into office. Mosheim went so far as to
maintain that the Defence of Champier was a myth (Versuch, &amp;c., einer
Ketzergeschichte, S. 72), and Dr. de Murr, though he did not question
its existence, never saw it. (<i>In Bibliothecas Hallerianas additamenta</i>,
4to. Helmst.) The Rev. Henri Tollin of Magdeburg has been more
fortunate; for he has not only seen but actually possesses copies of both
the Apologetic defences, as well as a copy of the pamphlet against the
Parisian Doctors, if I understand him aright. In a letter with which I
was lately favoured, he informs me that he intends to publish the more
interesting passages from the Defence of Champier, and the entire Tract
on Judicial Astrology.</p></div>

This, the second edition of Villanovanus’s Ptolemy, is one of the
very rare books. All of the impression that could be discovered when
Servetus was burned in effigy at Vienne, along with his <i>Christianismi

<i>Habes in hoc Libro, prudens Lector, utriusque Instrumenti novam
Tralationem editam a Reverendo sacr&aelig; theologi&aelig; Doctore Sancte Pagnini.</i>
Lugdun. 1527-28, fol. Such is the title of this, which we presume to be
the first edition of Pagnini’s Bible. Between it and the one of Cologne
of 1541, edited by Melchior Novesianus, we find no other until we come
to that of Villanovanus. Pagnini is said in the letter of J. F. Pico de
Mirandola, which precedes the text, to have been twenty-five years
engaged on the work. It is accompanied by no fewer than two commendatory
epistles from Popes Adrian VI. and Clement VII., and is said to
be the first edition of the Bible that is found divided into chapters.
Richard Simon (<i>Hist. du vieux Testament</i>, liv. ii.) speaks slightingly of
its merits; but it has been highly prized by others, as good judges as
he. To us it appears a very admirable version, our own English Bible
being generally so like it, that we fancy it must have been used by our
Translators.</p></div>

It is a capital mistake to suppose, as Mosheim and others have done,
that the <i>Christianismi Restitutio</i> was ever exposed for sale, or readily to be
had either at Geneva or elsewhere. It cannot be shown that more than four
or five copies at most of the book ever left the bales in which the whole impression
was packed. There was, <i>first</i>, the copy sent, as I venture to think,
by Servetus through Frelon to Calvin, which led to the arrest and trial
at Vienne. <i>Second</i>, the copy taken from the five bales seized at Lyons
for the use of the Inquisitor Ory. <i>Third</i>, the copy transmitted for their
inspection to the Swiss Churches and Councils. <i>Fourth</i>, the copy given
to Colladon by way of Brief by Calvin, with the passages underscored,
on which Servetus was finally arraigned and condemned. And <i>Fifth</i>,
the copy which we find Calvin sending to Bullinger at his request. Of
these copies one may even have served two ends: after making the
round of the Churches and coming again into Calvin’s hands, it may very
well have been that which he despatched to Bullinger. That the book
was not to be had immediately after the execution of Servetus is proved
conclusively by what Sebastian Castellio, the accredited author of the
work entitled, <i>Contra Libellum Calvini</i>, says on the subject: <i>He had not
been able to obtain a sight of Servetus’s book, so as to inform himself of
what he writes, Calvin having taken such pains to have it burned&mdash;‘cum
Serveti libros, quippe combustos diligentia Calvini, non habeam, ut ex iis
possem videre quid scriberet.’</i> The <i>Christianismi Restitutio</i>, in fact, remained
completely unknown in the Republic of Letters until its existence
was proclaimed by Wotton in his <i>Reflections on Learning, Ancient and
Modern</i>, in the year 1694 (all but a century and a half after the death of
its author), by the publication of the passage on the pulmonary circulation,
extracted, we must conclude, from the copy that was then in England,
and subsequently became, if it were not already, the property of Dr.
Meade&mdash;the identical copy with the name on the title-page of Germain
Colladon, the advocate who prosecuted Servetus at the instance of Calvin,
now in the national library of Paris.</p></div>

It were beyond the scope of my work to pursue this subject further;
but let me say that having compared the first edition of the ‘Loci’ (1521)
with the one of 1536 and others, of which there are copies in the British
Museum Library, I find it impossible to overlook the influence of
Servetus on Melanchthon, as of Melanchthon on Servetus. For fuller information
the reader is referred to Tollin’s exhaustive, <i>Philip Melanchthon

It may be well to remark on the confusion in the notice of the
<i>volume</i> or book which in Trie’s second letter, as we read it, is said to have
been sent among other documents, twenty-four in number; whilst in his
third epistle he regrets that <i>the volume</i> cannot be forwarded at the moment,
because of its having been lent two years ago to a friend of Calvin,
resident in Lausanne. The ‘great book’ first sent may have been the
copy of Calvin’s ‘Institutes,’ annotated on the margins by Servetus; a
conclusion that is borne out by the reference, by and by made in the impending
trial, towards the end of the first day’s proceedings, to pages
421-424, where Baptism is the subject treated. The volume that cannot
be forwarded at the time, because it had been lent to some one in
Lausanne, is certainly the MS. copy of the ‘Restitutio Christianismi,’ sent
by Servetus to Calvin some years before for his strictures, which he could
never get returned, Calvin having lent it to Viret of Lausanne, and grown
careless to take so much notice of the writer as would have been implied
in recovering and returning him his work.</p></div>

<i>D&eacute;claration pour maintenir la vraie foy</i>; original ed., p. 354. Let
us reiterate that Servetus spoke truly when he said that the comment on
Palestine was none of his. We have already said that it is copied without
change of a word from the Ptolemy of Pirckheimer. We add further
that the scholium of the German editor was not challenged by Erasmus,
Melanchthon, or Œcolampadius, who seem all to have corresponded with
Pirckheimer on his edition. (<i>Vide</i> Tollin, in <i>Zeitschrift der Gesellschaft
f&uuml;r Erdkunde zu Berlin</i>. Bd. f&uuml;r 1875.) It was only, therefore, when
the comment came to be looked at through the distorting medium of
personal enmity that it was seen as libelling Moses and outraging the
Holy Ghost.</p></div>

The documents connected with the case of Bolsec must, we apprehend,
have been communicated to Servetus. He often uses the same
words as his predecessor in Calvin’s displeasure; and imitates him also
in the desire he expresses to have Calvin interrogated and put on his
trial for certain matters especially interesting to himself.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_81" href="#FNanchor_81" class="label">81</a>
There is in fact a minute in the <i>Records of Geneva</i> of a formal requisition
made by Farel on October 30, and so three days after the
execution of Servetus, to have Wm. Geroult summoned to appear and
give an account of himself to the Council. The Lieutenant-Criminel,
Tissot, had even, as it seems, been charged with the business of making
the necessary inquiries preliminary to the institution of a criminal suit.
But we find no mention of any further step being taken in the matter.
The civil authorities, with three days for reflection, probably thought
that enough, more than enough perhaps, had already been done by the
burning of the principal offender.</p></div>

Here is what Servetus says on this subject, in connection with the
Sabellian or Patripassian heresy, in his earlier work: As the proper
passion of the flesh is to be born, so is it the proper passion of the flesh
to suffer, to be scourged, to be crucified, to die. But all this does not
touch the spirit, for it is not the soul that suffers or that dies, but the
body. Who so profane as to imagine that the angel in me dies although
I die? (<i>De Trinitatis Erroribus</i>, f. 76, b.)</p></div>

Par Jean Calvin. Contre les Erreurs de Michel Servet, Espaignol; o&ugrave; il

ce meschant &agrave; est&eacute; execut&eacute; par justice en la Ville de Gen&egrave;ve. Chez Jean

fuisse supplicium, per Johannem Calvinum. Apud Olivum Roberti
Stephani, 1554, p. 262. 8vo. Both of the versions are subscribed by all
the Genevese clergy, and though they differ somewhat in minute particulars,
they agree in everything essential. We have fine copies of both
originals in our national Library.</p></div>

For a more particular account of Calvin’s severities, the reader is
referred to a paper by M. Galiffe in the <i>M&eacute;moires de l’Institut National
de Gen&egrave;ve</i> for 1862, p. 79. But torture was an old institution in Geneva,
and Servetus is said only to have escaped the rack on the remonstrance
of Vandel, one of the senators of the libertine party. In older days we
read of one Postel, who, failing to answer so satisfactorily as was desired
when cited before the Roman Catholic bishop and his court, for some
offence, was ‘suspended by the rope’&mdash;by the wrists we believe. A first
suspension, however, not proving effectual, a second was ordered; but it
being now dinner time, the culprit was suspended a second time whilst
his lordship the bishop dined! In more recent times, and under Calvin’s
rule, a certain Billiard, having been guilty of jeering at the thunder and
lightning during a terrible storm, whilst the inhabitants of Geneva generally
were on their knees praying to God for mercy, was adjudged to be lashed
by the common hangman at the tail of a cart through the streets of the
city! Germain Colladon declared that he deserved death; but as he had
a wife and family they might be content with the scourging!</p></div>

claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United

  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with

Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
